    "instruction":"I'm writing a NeurIPS paper about a new model architecture for processing and generating long texts. Here are some facts about the paper:\n* The main trick is to replace some of the attention heads with an exponential moving average, where the decay rate is learned for each head. We call this architecture ExeMA.\n* On language modeling, the perplexity difference between our model and a vanilla transformer is negligible, but that's because next-token prediction is almost always a local task, so perplexity won't be sensitive enough to detect any improvements in long-range understanding.\n* However, on the SCROLLS benchmark, our model improves by 10% over the baseline.\n* We also have a new metric for measuring coherence in generated text (CoGnaTe), where our model generates text that is 43% more coherent than the baseline.\nHelp me write the paper's introduction.\n",
    "output_1":"Lately, Transformers have become the workhorse for almost any NLP task. However, their quadratic complexity makes training them prohibitively expensive, even on modern TPUs. Moreover, when generating long texts, they exhibit strong bias towards recent words, and generate incoherent text.\nTo address these issues, we propose ExeMA, a simple extension to vanilla Transformers. ExeMA is a family of models that replace a portion of the attention heads with an exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA is updated with a learned rate and uses a learned decay. We train ExeMA on a language modeling task and show that it doesn't improve perplexity, because the language modeling task is mostly local. But it does improve performance on long-range understanding tasks, such as text coherence.\n",

We propose a novel architecture, ExeMA, that improves the coherence of long texts generated by transformer-based models.\n2. We introduce a new metric, CoGnaTe, that measures the coherence of generated text, and show that ExeMA improves CoGnaTe scores by 43%.\n\nThese results demonstrate the potential of our approach to address one of the key limitations of transformer-based models, and suggest that future work in this area could yield further improvements in text coherence.\n",

    "output_1":"Here is one way to do it. Let the actions be $A = \\{ \\textrm{Rock}, \\textrm{Paper}, \\textrm{Scissors} \\}$. Define the payoff function $u: A \\times A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as\n$$u(a, b) = \\begin{cases}\n  +1 & \\textrm{if } a = b \\\\\n  -1 & \\textrm{if } a \\neq b.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSince there are only three possible actions, there are $3^2 = 9$ pairs of actions. If we enumerate these actions as $(a_1, a_2), (a_2, a_3), \\dots, (a_8, a_9)$, then $u(a_i, a_j) = -1$ if $i \\neq j$, and $u(a_i, a_i) = 1$. We can write the payoff matrix:\n$$U = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n  -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n  -1 & -1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe mixed strategies are the column vectors of $U$. If we denote them as $\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$, then\n$$U = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\pi_1 \\\\\n  \\pi_2 \\\\\n  \\pi_3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\qquad\\text{where}\\qquad\n\\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = \\mathbf{1}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}$ is the all-ones vector. So for example, $\\pi_1$ is the column vector $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$ of probabilities.\n\nWe can write the expected payoff matrix:\n$$U^T \\cdot U = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $U^T$ is the transpose of $U$. Since the rows of $U^T \\cdot U$ all add up to $1$, there is a unique Nash equilibrium:\n$$(\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3) = \\mathbf{1} = (\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$$\nThe game is called symmetric.\n\nAn example of an asymmetric game is if you change the payoffs to\n$$u(a, b) = \\begin{cases}\n  -2 & \\textrm{if } a = b \\\\\n  -1 & \\textrm{if } a \\neq b.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nHere, the matrix $U^T \\cdot U$ is\n$$U^T \\cdot U = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n  1 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n  -1 & 1 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe expected payoff matrix is\n$$U^T \\cdot U \\cdot U^T = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  -1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAgain, the rows all add up to $1$, so there is a unique Nash equilibrium:\n$$(\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3) = \\mathbf{1} = (\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$$\nThe game is still symmetric, but this is the unique equilibrium, because no one can profitably deviate from it.\n",

For $S$, the second player will do best by playing $P$. So the only Nash equilibrium is $(R,S)$.\n\nThis can be found in a few different ways. For instance, one can consider the minimax strategy for player one: in order to minimize the maximum loss, player one should play $R$. Similarly, one can consider the maximin strategy for player two: in order to maximize the minimum payoff, player two should play $S$. These strategies coincide, since both player one and player two should play $R$. Alternatively, one can find the Nash equilibrium directly by considering all four possibilities.\n",

If we had a \"meritocracy\" that only allowed native born Americans to start companies, we would have missed out on WhatsApp.\n\nDiversity also helps you reach more customers. If you only have white male engineers building products, you are going to miss out on a lot of potential customers. For example, Facebook has over 1 billion users, and a large portion of those users are women and minorities. If Facebook only had white male engineers building products, they would have missed out on a huge opportunity.\n\nFinally, diversity helps attract more talent.

    "instruction":"What medicine should I take when I get a cold?\n",
    "output_1":"Getting a cold is an inevitability when it comes to being human. While most colds are not dangerous and simply last a week or two, it is important to care for your body while sick. Colds can be dangerous for those who have underlying conditions, and can cause serious complications, such as pneumonia.\n\n## Over-the-counter medicine\n\n1. Get some Vitamin C. A good vitamin C supplement will help your body fight the cold. Take 1000 mg a day to get a boost.\n2. Get a zinc supplement. Zinc can help boost your immune system. Look for a lozenge that contains zinc, or take a zinc supplement.\n3. Use a humidifier. A humidifier will help loosen congestion in your nose and throat. Humidifiers come in a variety of forms, such as small desktop humidifiers that you can use at your desk or large cool mist humidifiers that you can use in a room.\n4. Use saline nasal spray. A saline nasal spray can help loosen and clear congestion in your nose. Saline nasal spray is safe and available over-the-counter.\n5. Try a nasal decongestant. A nasal decongestant can help dry up mucus in your nose. You can use a nasal decongestant in conjunction with a saline nasal spray. Nasal decongestants come in spray form, or as small pills. However, be careful when using nasal decongestants, as they can cause increased blood pressure and heart rate. If you have high blood pressure, you may want to avoid nasal decongestants.\n6. Take a pain reliever. A pain reliever can help you cope with the aches and pains of a cold. Pain relievers are safe to take when sick, but you should avoid taking more than the recommended dose.\n7. Use an antihistamine. An antihistamine can help dry up excess mucus in your nose. It can also help you sleep if you are having trouble sleeping while sick. Antihistamines are safe to take when sick.\n8. Take an expectorant. An expectorant can help loosen up mucus in your lungs and throat. Take a small dose to help clear your chest.\n9. Use an oral decongestant. An oral decongestant can help loosen mucus in your throat. You can use an oral decongestant in conjunction with a saline nasal spray and a nasal decongestant.\n10. Take a cough suppressant. A cough suppressant can help ease a cough. Take a small dose of a cough suppressant to help you sleep.\n11. Take a cold medicine. Cold medicines usually contain antihistamines, pain relievers, and decongestants. They can be helpful when you are sick, but are not usually necessary.\n\n## Over-the-counter medicines with a prescription\n\n1. Take an antiviral medicine. There are a few different antiviral medicines that can help speed up recovery from a cold. If you have a cold and you want to speed up recovery, you may be able to take an antiviral medicine. However, these medicines are only effective if taken early in the cold. You will need a prescription to take an antiviral medicine.\n2. Take an antibiotic. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections. Colds are caused by viruses, not bacteria, and will not be helped by antibiotics. Antibiotics can also damage your gut flora, which can cause other problems.\n3. Use an antibiotic. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections. Colds are caused by viruses, not bacteria, and will not be helped by antibiotics.

    "instruction":"Can you explain dependency injection in C# like a gangster?\n",
    "output_1":"Sure, here is an explanation like a gangster:\n\nLet's say you're building a web application. At some point, you need to write some code that interacts with a database. You could write a few dozen lines of code that establish a connection, execute a query, and handle any errors. But what happens if you want to use a different database? Or what if you want to change how your queries are executed? Instead of writing your own code to deal with these scenarios, you could use dependency injection.\n\nDependency injection is a technique where dependencies are provided by an external source, rather than being hardcoded into the dependent object. In your web application, the database connection information would be provided by a configuration file, rather than being hardcoded into your code. When you need to execute a query, you would write code that accepts a database connection as a parameter. This parameter would be provided by the dependency injection mechanism, rather than being hardcoded into your code.\n\nSo, how does dependency injection work? Well, here's an example:\n\nSay you have a class that needs to write data to a database. To do this, it needs a database connection. Traditionally, you would write code that establishes a connection and executes the query. But what if you want to use a different database? Or what if you want to change how your queries are executed? That's where dependency injection comes in. Instead of writing your own code to deal with these scenarios, you would tell the dependency injection mechanism that your class needs a database connection. The dependency injection mechanism would then be responsible for providing your class with the appropriate database connection.\n\nSo, how does dependency injection work? Well, here's an example:\n\nSay you have a class that needs to write data to a database. To do this, it needs a database connection. Traditionally, you would write code that establishes a connection and executes the query. But what if you want to use a different database? Or what if you want to change how your queries are executed? That's where dependency injection comes in. Instead of writing your own code to deal with these scenarios, you would tell the dependency injection mechanism that your class needs a database connection. The dependency injection mechanism would then be responsible for providing your class with the appropriate database connection.\n\nThe first step is to add a reference to a dependency injection framework. There are a number of good options available, including:\n* Castle Windsor\n* Autofac\n* Unity\n* Ninject\n\nNext, you need to configure the dependency injection framework. This usually involves creating a configuration file that specifies which classes need to be injected and which dependencies they need.\n\nFinally, you need to tell the dependency injection framework how to resolve the dependencies. This usually involves creating a factory class that is responsible for creating the dependent objects. The factory class should be registered with the dependency injection framework so that it can be used to resolve dependencies.\n\nSo, here's an example of how to use dependency injection to write data to a database:\n\n1. Add a reference to a dependency injection framework.\n2. Configure the dependency injection framework.\n3. Create a factory class that is responsible for creating the dependent object.\n4. Register the factory class with the dependency injection framework.\n5. In your class that needs to write data to a database, accept a database connection as a parameter.\n6. Inject the database connection into your class using the dependency injection framework.\n7. Use the database connection to write data to the database.\n",

    "output_1":"The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis is a theory that suggests that there are two types of neurons in the brain: vital and redundant. Vital neurons are necessary for the network to function properly, whereas redundant neurons are not. The hypothesis proposes that a trained neural network can be pruned by removing redundant neurons, resulting in a smaller, faster network with comparable accuracy.\n\nThe hypothesis is based on the idea that deep neural networks, like the human brain, contain both vital and redundant neurons. Vital neurons are necessary for the network to function properly, whereas redundant neurons are not. The hypothesis proposes that a trained neural network can be pruned by removing redundant neurons, resulting in a smaller, faster network with comparable accuracy.\n\nThe hypothesis is supported by recent experiments that have shown that pruning deep neural networks can result in smaller, faster models with comparable accuracy.\n\nThe hypothesis has important implications for the design and development of deep learning algorithms. If the hypothesis is correct, it suggests that neural networks may be more efficient than previously thought, as redundant neurons can be removed without significantly affecting performance. This may lead to more efficient deep learning algorithms in the future.\n\nThe hypothesis is still under active investigation, and more research is needed to determine its validity.\n",

    "output_2":"The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits that deep neural networks (DNNs) contain redundant weights that can be pruned to a subset that still yields the same accuracy. This is contrary to the commonly held belief that DNNs learn useful representations through training.  This hypothesis is still controversial.\n\nThis paper uses the following example to motivate their hypothesis:\n\n> We train a simple two-layer neural network to classify MNIST digits. We then randomly sample the weights of the first layer and set many of them to zero. Surprisingly, we find that the accuracy of the network on the training set remains almost unchanged. We then repeat the same procedure on the second layer, but now we find that the accuracy drops by 5%. Finally we train a new network from scratch and find that this network also generalizes, but it reaches only 93% accuracy, compared to the original network's 99%.\n\nThis suggests that DNNs don't necessarily learn useful representations. Instead, random initialization in the first layer \"wins the lottery\" by stumbling upon a good configuration of weights that is then replicated in the second layer. This is also supported by the fact that they observed a similar phenomenon in convolutional networks, where randomly setting filters to zero in the first layer had no effect on accuracy, but doing so in later layers did.\n\nThey use two arguments to support the LTH.\n\n1. Random subnetworks of trained DNNs can have equivalent or even higher accuracy.\n2. There are many redundant parameters in DNNs that can be removed without affecting accuracy.\n\nThis has important implications for training deep neural networks. It may be possible to train much shallower DNNs that have equivalent or even higher accuracy, which would be significantly more efficient.\n\nThe LTH is currently an active area of research. There are multiple proposed methods for training lottery ticket subnetworks.\n\nThis paper was published in the Proceedings of the Thirty-Second International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2018).\n",

In self-attention, the input is $X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$ and the output is $Y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$. The attention scores are computed as:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \\mathrm{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)V.\n$$\n\nHere $Q$, $K$, and $V$ are queries, keys, and values.\nWe can further expand it as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V) \n&= \\mathrm{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)V \\\\\n&= \\mathrm{softmax}\\left(\\frac{XW_Q^\\top W_K}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)W_V \\\\\n&= \\mathrm{softmax}\\left(\\frac{W_QW_K^\\top}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)W_V \\\\\n&= \\mathrm{softmax}\\left(W_QW_K^\\top W_V^\\top W_V\\right) \\\\\n&= \\mathrm{softmax}\\left(\\frac{XW_X^\\top}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_Q$, $W_K$, and $W_V$ are learnable parameters, and $W_X=W_QW_K^\\top W_V^\\top W_V$ is also learnable.\nAs seen, the position information is encoded in the learnable parameter $W_X$. If we use learnable position embeddings instead of learnable parameters, we can achieve length generalization.\n\nThe above discussion can also be applied to the multi-head attention.

This is a very common technique in transformer models.\n\nNow, to the question:\n\nIf you want to train a model that works well for all sequence lengths, one thing you can do is add position embeddings to the tokens in the sequence. This will help the model learn that different positions have different meanings, so it can learn to generalize across sequence lengths.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nLet's say you have a sequence of tokens [a, b, c, d, e], and you want to add position embeddings to it. The simplest thing you can do is just add a single embedding vector for the whole sequence:\n\n[a, b, c, d, e] + [pos_emb_1] = [a + pos_emb_1, b + pos_emb_1, c + pos_emb_1, d + pos_emb_1, e + pos_emb_1]\n\nBut if the sequence is long, this might not be enough, because the embedding vector for the last token will be far away from the embedding vector for the first token. To fix this, you can add multiple embedding vectors, one for each position in the sequence:\n\n[a, b, c, d, e] + [pos_emb_1, pos_emb_2, pos_emb_3] = [a + pos_emb_1, b + pos_emb_2, c + pos_emb_3, d + pos_emb_1, e + pos_emb_2]\n\nThis way, each token will have its own position embedding, and the model can learn to use the position embeddings to encode the position information.\n",

    "instruction":"how to relieve stress from work\n",
    "output_1":"Everyone feels stress from time to time. Stress is your body's natural response to a situation that it perceives as dangerous or difficult. While a little bit of stress can be beneficial and motivate you to get things done, too much stress can be harmful. If you feel like the stress in your life is getting out of control, try some of these tips to relax and relieve some of the tension.\n\n## Deal with stress at work\n\n1. Set aside time for yourself. Schedule in some time to relax and unwind. This could be as simple as setting aside 5 minutes at the beginning or end of the day to sit quietly and breathe or taking a walk during your lunch break.\n2. Take breaks throughout the day. Set a timer or an alarm to remind yourself to take a break. Get up and move around for a couple of minutes, go get a drink of water, or take a short walk.\n3. Eat healthy foods. Avoid eating a lot of simple carbohydrates like candy and chips, which can cause your blood sugar to spike and crash, leaving you feeling tired and stressed. Instead, eat healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.\n4. Learn to say no. It is often hard to say no, but if you are already feeling stressed at work, you don't need to add more to your plate.\n5. Ask for help. Don't be afraid to ask for help from your co-workers if you are feeling stressed. A little extra assistance can go a long way toward reducing your workload and making things easier.\n6. Learn how to say no politely. If you can't say no to someone, try saying \"I would love to help you with that, but I am currently very busy with [X]. When would be a good time to discuss [Y]?\" This will help the other person understand that you are not able to help right now but are open to discussing the matter later.\n7. Learn how to delegate. If you are feeling stressed at work, it may be because you are trying to do too much on your own. Learn how to delegate tasks to other people so that you can focus on the most important things.\n8. Learn how to say no without feeling guilty. If you find yourself feeling guilty when you say no, try to remember that you have to prioritize your own health and well-being before anyone else's. Saying no doesn't mean you are a bad person, it just means that you are taking care of yourself.\n9. Find a hobby to unwind. Find something you enjoy doing outside of work that helps you relax. This could be anything from gardening to reading to taking a yoga class.\n10. Talk to someone about your stress. If you are feeling overwhelmed and stressed at work, it is important to talk to someone about it. This could be a trusted friend, therapist, or doctor. Talking to someone can help you to better understand your feelings and find ways to cope.\n\n## Deal with stress at home\n\n1. Set aside time for yourself. Schedule in some time to relax and unwind. This could be as simple as setting aside 5 minutes at the beginning or end of the day to sit quietly and breathe or taking a walk during your lunch break.\n2. Take breaks throughout the day. Set a timer or an alarm to remind yourself to take a break. Get up and move around for a couple of minutes, go get a drink of water, or take a short walk.\n3. Eat healthy foods. Avoid eating a lot of simple carbohydrates like candy and chips, which can cause your blood sugar to spike and crash, leaving you feeling tired and stressed.

    "output_2":"You should first understand the reason why you are stressed.  Do you have too much work?  Are you under pressure to complete a project?  Or are you having trouble with a coworker?  Once you understand the source of your stress, you can take steps to relieve it.\n\n## Talk to your boss\n\n1. Make an appointment with your boss.  If you don't already have one scheduled, ask your boss if you can have a meeting.  Say something like, \"I was hoping we could set up a meeting this week to go over some projects I'm working on.\"  This will signal to your boss that you need to discuss something important, but that you aren't upset about it.\n2. Let your boss know how you are feeling.  Once you are in your meeting, say something like, \"I wanted to talk to you about my workload.\"  Then explain how you are feeling stressed.  Don't complain or be accusatory.  Instead, explain how you feel and how you think the situation could be improved.\n3. Suggest ways that your workload could be adjusted.  After you've told your boss how you're feeling, you should make a few suggestions about how your workload could be adjusted to relieve your stress.  For example, you could suggest that you take on fewer projects, that you delegate some tasks, or that you be allowed to work from home one day a week.\n4. Ask your boss to help you.  You may also want to ask your boss if there is anything you can do to help reduce the stress.  For example, you could ask your boss if there are any projects you can help with.  This will show your boss that you are willing to work together to find a solution to your stress.\n5. Set up a follow-up meeting.  If you and your boss are unable to come to an agreement about how to adjust your workload, you may want to set up another meeting to discuss it.  Let your boss know when you would like to meet again, and then follow up with him or her.\n\n## Find a support system\n\n1. Talk to a friend or family member.  One of the best ways to relieve stress is to talk to someone you trust.  This can be a friend, a family member, or a coworker.  Tell them how you are feeling and ask them for their advice on how to relieve your stress.  You may also want to ask them to listen to you when you are feeling stressed.  It can be helpful to vent your frustrations to someone else.\n2. Join a support group.  If you don't have a friend or family member to talk to, you may want to join a support group.  Support groups are designed to help people who are dealing with the same problem.  These groups are usually led by a therapist or social worker, and they can be a great way to meet other people who are dealing with the same issues as you.\n3. Talk to a therapist.  If you are having trouble relieving your stress on your own, you may want to talk to a therapist.  Therapists are trained professionals who can help you deal with your stress.  They can help you understand why you are feeling stressed, and they can help you find ways to relieve your stress.\n\n## Practice healthy habits\n\n1. Get enough sleep.  One of the best ways to relieve stress is to get enough sleep.  If you are tired, you are more likely to feel stressed out.  Make sure that you are getting enough sleep every night.  This means going to bed early and getting up early in the morning.  If you are having trouble sleeping, you may want to talk to a therapist or doctor.\n2. Eat a healthy diet.  Another important way to relieve stress is to eat a healthy diet.  When you are stressed out, you are more likely to eat unhealthy foods.  These foods will only make you feel worse.  Instead, make sure that you are eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables.\n3. Exercise regularly.  Exercise is another great way to relieve stress.  It can help you relax and it can also improve your mood.  Try to exercise at least three times a week for 30 minutes each time.  This can help you relieve your stress and improve your health.\n4. Practice relaxation techniques.  One of the best ways to relieve stress is to practice relaxation techniques.  These techniques can help you relax your body and calm your mind.  Try deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga.  You can also try progressive muscle relaxation.  These techniques can help you relieve your stress and improve your health.\n\n## Find a hobby\n\n1. Find a hobby that you enjoy.  One of the best ways to relieve stress is to find a hobby that you enjoy.  Hobbies can help you relax and they can also distract you\n",

    "instruction":"Why do my fiddle fig leaves look yellow?\n",
    "output_1":"Fiddle leaf figs are beautiful houseplants that provide a bit of tropical flair to your home. With large, wide leaves and a tall, upright growth habit, they can make a striking statement in a room. However, it's not uncommon for fiddle leaf fig owners to notice that some of their leaves are turning yellow.\n\nIf your fiddle leaf fig has yellow leaves, don't despair. There are several common reasons why this might happen, and most of them are easy to fix. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the most common causes of yellow fiddle leaf fig leaves and discuss what you can do to help your plant bounce back.\n\n## Check the soil\n\n1. Feel the soil. Gently push your finger into the top layer of soil, about 2.5 cm (1 inch) deep. If the soil feels dry, your plant may be suffering from dehydration.\n2. Check the drainage. Fiddle leaf figs prefer well-draining soil, so if your pot has no drainage holes, it may be time to repot your plant.\n3. Check the pH. Fiddle leaf figs prefer slightly acidic soil, with a pH between 6.0 and 6.5. If the pH is too high, the soil can become alkaline, which can cause yellowing leaves. To check the pH of your soil, you can purchase a soil pH test kit from a garden center or home improvement store.\n4. Add fertilizer. Fiddle leaf figs are heavy feeders and will benefit from regular fertilizing. Use a balanced fertilizer that contains equal amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Apply the fertilizer according to the package directions.\n\n## Increase humidity\n\n1. Mist the plant. If your fiddle leaf fig is showing signs of dehydration, misting the leaves with a spray bottle can help improve humidity levels around the plant.\n2. Set the plant on a tray of wet pebbles. This is a great way to increase humidity levels around your fiddle leaf fig without having to mist the plant regularly. Simply fill a tray or saucer with pebbles and add enough water to cover the pebbles by about 2.5 cm (1 inch). Place the pot on top of the pebbles, making sure the pot does not sit in the water. As the water evaporates, it will increase humidity levels around the plant.\n3. Place the plant on a humidifier. Humidifiers come in a variety of sizes and styles, so you should be able to find one that will work for your fiddle leaf fig. Simply place the pot on top of the humidifier and let it run.\n4. Place the plant near a steamer. If you have a bathroom with a shower, you can place your fiddle leaf fig near the steamer. The steam from the shower will increase humidity levels in the room, helping to keep your plant happy.\n\n## Increase sunlight\n\n1. Move the plant to a brighter location. If your fiddle leaf fig is getting too little sunlight, simply move it to a brighter location. Fiddle leaf figs prefer bright, indirect light, so try to find a spot near a window that gets plenty of natural light.\n2. Rotate the plant. If you can't move your fiddle leaf fig to a brighter location, try rotating the pot so that all sides of the plant get equal amounts of sunlight. This will help prevent one side of the plant from becoming leggy and thin while another side remains dense and bushy.\n3. Add a grow light. If your fiddle leaf fig is getting too little sunlight, you can also add a grow light to supplement natural light. Fiddle leaf figs prefer cool white lights, so choose a light that emits a cooler color temperature.\n4. Add a UV bulb. Ultraviolet (UV) bulbs emit UVA and UVB light, which helps plants produce vitamin D. If you can't provide your fiddle leaf fig with enough sunlight, adding a UV bulb will help your plant produce the vitamin D it needs.\n\n## Increase temperature\n\n1. Move the plant to a warmer location. Fiddle leaf figs prefer temperatures between 21\u00b0C and 26\u00b0C (70\u00b0F and 80\u00b0F). If your plant is getting too cold, simply move it to a warmer location.\n2. Increase the temperature. If you can't move your fiddle leaf fig to a warmer location, you can also increase the temperature around the plant. Simply set a space heater near the plant or wrap the pot in a heating pad. Be careful not to overheat the plant, though. Fiddle leaf figs prefer warm temperatures, not hot temperatures.\n3. Lower the humidity. If your fiddle leaf fig is getting too much humidity, try lowering the humidity levels around the plant. Simply stop misting the plant or remove it from the tray of wet pebbles.\n\n## Adjust the watering schedule\n\n1. Water less\n",

    "output_2":"Fiddle-leaf figs are one of the most popular indoor plants, and for good reason: they're easy to care for and can grow quite large.  They also have a unique, fiddle-shaped leaf that makes them stand out.\nHowever, fiddle-leaf figs can be prone to leaf yellowing.  There are a few reasons why this might happen, but don't worry - most of the time it's nothing to be concerned about and your plant will bounce back.\n\n## Causes of yellow leaves on fiddle-leaf fig\n\n1.  Too much sunlight - Fiddle-leaf figs prefer bright, indirect light.  If they're getting too much direct sun, their leaves will start to yellow.  Try moving the plant to a different spot or using a sheer curtain to filter the sunlight.\n\n2.  Not enough humidity - Fiddle-leaf figs need moderate humidity to stay healthy.  If your home is dry, consider misting the leaves or using a humidifier nearby.\n\n3.  Not enough water - Fiddle-leaf figs need consistent watering to stay healthy.  Make sure to water the plant when the top inch or so of soil is dry.  If you water too much, the roots will rot, causing yellow leaves.\n\n4.  Pests - Spider mites, mealybugs, and scale insects can all cause yellow leaves on fiddle-leaf figs.  Make sure to check the plant regularly for any signs of infestation and treat immediately.\n\n5.  Overfertilizing - Fiddle-leaf figs don't need much fertilizer, and too much can actually cause yellow leaves.  Make sure to follow the instructions on the fertilizer label and only fertilize once every few months.\n\n6.  Not enough fertilizer - Fiddle-leaf figs need a small amount of fertilizer to stay healthy.  Make sure to fertilize them every few months, following the instructions on the fertilizer label.\n\n7.  Underwatered - Fiddle-leaf figs need consistent watering to stay healthy.  Make sure to water the plant when the top inch or so of soil is dry.  If you water too much, the roots will rot, causing yellow leaves.\n",

    "output_1":"Here are some ideas on how to deal with this situation:\n\n* Take the time to understand the other person's perspective. Ask them why they feel the need to escalate things up the management chain. Listen without judgment and try to empathize with their point of view. This may help you understand why they feel the need to do this and help you find a solution that works for both of you.\n* Find a win-win solution. Try to find a way to resolve the issue that satisfies both of your needs and interests. This may require compromise on both sides, but it's worth the effort to find a solution that works for everyone.\n* Be proactive in addressing problems. Don't let small issues fester and grow into bigger problems. If you see something that could potentially become a problem, address it right away.\n* Communicate clearly. Make sure that both of you are on the same page regarding project goals and timelines. Set expectations early on and provide regular updates to avoid misunderstandings.\n* Be professional. Even if you are frustrated with your colleague's behavior, remain professional and courteous in your interactions. This will help to defuse any tense situations that may arise and keep the focus on finding a solution.\n\nIn conclusion, it's important to remember that we all have different styles and approaches to solving problems. Try to understand the other person's perspective and find a win-win solution. Be proactive in addressing problems and communicate clearly. Finally, be professional in your interactions, even when you're frustrated. Following these guidelines will help you work more effectively with your colleague and keep the focus on what matters most - getting the job done.\n",

    "output_2":"If you need this project to go well and be successful, you might need to work with this colleague even if you don't like them or you think they are causing problems. That means you need to find a way to work with them.\n\nFirst, look at your interactions with your colleague. Are you being reactive? Are you taking things personally? Do you think they are taking things personally? Do you have a history of conflict with them?  If so, you might want to think about what you can do to change the way you interact. Try to take the high road and not be reactive or defensive. Try to find some common ground and focus on what you can agree on. If you are already doing that, it's time to talk to your colleague.\n\nYou might be able to start with a conversation that is neutral and not about the project. You might ask them about a work related activity that you have in common. You might ask them about something non-work related, like how was their weekend or what they did on vacation. The goal is to have a conversation where you are talking about something other than the project and something where you can find common ground.\n\nIf that goes well, you can then start talking about the project and your roles on it.  You might start by asking them what they think your roles should be and how they think things should work between the two of you. Or you might ask them what they want to get out of this project and what they are most worried about. The goal is to have a conversation where you are talking about what will happen on the project, not about what has happened in the past.\n\nIf that goes well, you can then ask them to help you. You might ask them to teach you about a part of the project that is new to you. Or you might ask them to be on the lookout for things that need your attention. You might ask them to make sure that you are involved in decisions that affect you. The goal is to make it clear that you are a team and you need to work together.\n\nIf that doesn't work, then you need to escalate it. You need to talk to your boss and tell them what is happening and ask for help. You might also talk to HR if you feel like there is a pattern of behavior that is affecting you or others.\n\nYour goal is to make it clear that you want to work together, but that you are not going to tolerate any behavior that hurts the project. If you are clear about that, your colleague should understand that they need to change their behavior. If they don't, then you have escalated it and you can move on to the next level of management.\n",

One reason is that men are more likely to hold jobs in higher-paying industries such as engineering, computer science, and finance. Another reason is that men are more likely to hold leadership positions, which come with higher pay. Finally, men are more likely to negotiate for higher salaries, while women are more likely to accept whatever salary is offered.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether these differences in pay are due to discrimination or due to women making different career choices. Some studies have found that even when controlling for differences in education, experience, and occupation, women still earn less than men. This suggests that discrimination may play a role. Other studies have found that women are just as likely as men to hold jobs in higher-paying industries but are less likely to hold leadership positions and less likely to negotiate for higher salaries. This suggests that differences in career choices may play a role.\n\nIn conclusion, there are multiple reasons why men earn more than women, and it is likely a combination of discrimination and differences in career choices.\n",

In many countries, there are legal restrictions on women working, or they are discouraged from working outside the home. In many countries, women are paid less than men for the same work, and this pay gap is sometimes justified by cultural or religious norms. In many countries, women are not allowed to hold certain jobs, such as jobs in the military or in mining. In some countries, women are not allowed to own property, which makes it more difficult for them to earn money and invest it. In many countries, women leave the workforce when they have children, while men do not, which reduces the amount of time they spend earning money. In many countries, women are expected to do more domestic work than men, which reduces the amount of time they spend working outside the home. In some countries, men are expected to provide for their families, while women are expected to take care of the children and the home. In some countries, women are less likely to pursue careers or careers in fields that pay well, such as STEM fields. In some countries, women are less likely to ask for raises or negotiate for higher salaries, which can reduce their earnings.

    "output_1":"As you said, this is a role-playing game, so it is a good idea to start with the most important question - how would this affect your characters?\n\nIn the next 30 years, you can probably expect to see:\n\n* Personal robot assistants,\n* Autonomous cars,\n* 3D printed organs,\n* Space tourism,\n* Permanent space stations,\n* Artificial intelligence that passes Turing test,\n* Brain-computer interfaces,\n* Robot sex workers,\n* Human cloning,\n* Cure for cancer.\n\nThose are some of the most likely advances in medicine, robotics, computer science, and space exploration. But what would be useful for characters?\n\n* Robot assistants could be useful for characters who need to multitask. For example, a police officer could have a robot assistant to help him or her with paperwork while patrolling.\n* Autonomous cars could be useful for characters who need to get around without being distracted by driving. For example, a surgeon could have a car that drives itself to the hospital and parks itself in the lot.\n* 3D printed organs could be useful for characters who need organ transplants. For example, a character with end-stage liver disease could have a new liver printed for them.\n* Space tourism could be useful for characters who want to see the world. For example, a character who is rich could go on a space tour to see the Earth from space.\n* Permanent space stations could be useful for characters who want to live off-world. For example, a character who is tired of living on Earth could move to a space station and live there permanently.\n* Artificial intelligence that passes Turing test could be useful for characters who need help with decision-making. For example, a character who is in charge of a large organization could use an AI assistant to help them make decisions.\n* Brain-computer interfaces could be useful for characters who need to communicate with others. For example, a character who is paralyzed could use a brain-computer interface to communicate with others.\n* Robot sex workers could be useful for characters who are looking for companionship. For example, a character who is lonely could have a robot sex worker as a companion.\n* Human cloning could be useful for characters who want to have children. For example, a character who cannot have children naturally could clone themselves and have children with their clone.\n* Cure for cancer could be useful for characters who have cancer. For example, a character who has been diagnosed with cancer could be cured with the new technology.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are many possible advances in technology over the next 30 years, the ones that would be most useful for characters are robot assistants, autonomous cars, 3D printed organs, space tourism, permanent space stations, artificial intelligence that passes Turing test, brain-computer interfaces, and robot sex workers.\n",

    "output_2":"Technology is an integral part of our society today, and its role will only continue to grow. To get an idea of what life might be like in the near future, it is helpful to look at the advances that are already occurring today. Here are some potential technologies that could shape the world of 2040:\n\n## Self-driving cars\n\nOne technology that is already changing the way we get around is self-driving cars. These cars use advanced sensors and artificial intelligence to navigate roads and avoid collisions. In the future, these cars could become even more advanced, allowing for fully autonomous driving.\n\nThis technology has the potential to transform the way we commute. For one, it could reduce the number of car accidents, saving thousands of lives each year. It could also reduce traffic congestion, as self-driving cars could travel more efficiently and use road space more effectively.\n\nIn addition, this technology could revolutionize the way we own cars. Instead of owning a car and paying for insurance, gas, and maintenance, people could simply hail a self-driving car when they need one. This could be a more cost-effective way to get around, especially for people who don't use their car often.\n\n## Artificial intelligence\n\nAnother technology that could radically change the way we live is artificial intelligence (AI). AI refers to computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding language, solving problems, and making decisions.\n\nToday, AI is already being used in many industries, from healthcare to finance. In the future, AI could become even more advanced, allowing for more complex tasks such as creative writing, designing products, and even performing surgeries.\n\nThis technology has the potential to transform many aspects of society, from the workplace to education. For example, AI could be used to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up workers to focus on more creative and fulfilling work. In addition, AI could be used to personalize learning, allowing students to learn at their own pace and in their own style.\n\n## Virtual reality\n\nVirtual reality (VR) is another technology that has the potential to radically change the way we live. VR refers to computer-generated environments that can be interacted with in a seemingly real way.\n\nToday, VR is already being used in many industries, from entertainment to healthcare. In the future, VR could become even more immersive and realistic, allowing people to experience virtual worlds that are indistinguishable from reality.\n\nThis technology has the potential to transform many aspects of society, from entertainment to education. For example, VR could be used to create immersive learning environments, allowing students to explore and experiment in ways that are not possible in the real world. In addition, VR could be used to create virtual communities, where people can interact with each other in real time, regardless of their location.\n\n## 3D printing\n\n3D printing is another technology that could revolutionize the way we live. 3D printing refers to the process of creating physical objects from digital models. Today, 3D printing is already being used in many industries, from manufacturing to medicine.\n\nIn the future, 3D printing could become even more advanced, allowing for the creation of complex, customized products. This technology has the potential to transform the way we design and manufacture products, as well as the way we consume goods.\n\nFor example, instead of buying a new product when it breaks, people could simply download the digital design of the product and print a new one. In addition, instead of buying goods from a store, people could print their own goods at home, customizing them to their exact specifications.\n\n## Genetic engineering\n\nGenetic engineering is another technology that has the potential to radically change the way we live. Genetic engineering refers to the process of modifying the genetic code of organisms to produce desired traits.\n\nToday, genetic engineering is already being used in many industries, from agriculture to medicine. In the future, genetic engineering could become even more advanced, allowing for the creation of more complex organisms.\n\nThis technology has the potential to transform many aspects of society, from food production to healthcare. For example, genetic engineering could be used to create new foods that are healthier, more nutritious, and more sustainable. In addition, genetic engineering could be used to create new medicines that are more effective and less harmful.\n",

This could include helping schools develop STEM curricula, or providing professional development training for teachers.\n* Partner with museums, science centers, and other STEM-focused organizations to offer discounted tickets to students.

Is that correct?\n\nAs far as STEM education goes, there are a number of ways to approach this. You could focus on providing supplemental instruction to students who are already enrolled in a regular school. This might include after-school programs, weekend or summer classes, or even online lessons. You could also target students who are homeschooled, or who are enrolled in online schools, and offer supplemental instruction for them.\n\nAnother approach would be to offer supplemental instruction for college students. This might include prep courses for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized tests, as well as supplemental instruction in particular subjects.\n\nYou could also develop online courses that target specific topics or skills. For example, you might develop a series of online lessons for high school students who are preparing for the SAT, or for college students who are struggling with calculus.\n\nFinally, you could develop software tools or online resources that teachers can use to supplement their classroom instruction. For example, you might develop an online portal where teachers can share lesson plans and other resources, or you might develop software tools that help teachers assess student progress and track individual student performance.\n",

Here are a few tips that may help:\n\n* Try to understand why your toddler is clinging. Is he afraid of something? Is he feeling insecure? Once you figure out the root cause, you can start working on solutions.\n* Give your toddler a sense of security and independence at the same time. Let him know that you're there for him if he needs you, but also encourage him to explore and play on his own.\n* Set boundaries and limits. Toddlers need structure and consistency, so make sure you're clear about what's okay and what's not.\n* Give your toddler plenty of one-on-one time. Spend time playing with him, reading to him, and talking to him.\n* Be patient and understanding. Clingy toddlers often feel anxious and insecure, so it's important to be patient and understanding.\n* Enlist the help of others. If your toddler is clinging to you, ask your spouse, partner, or another trusted adult to spend some time with him.\n* Try distraction. If your toddler is clinging to you, try distracting him with a favorite toy, game, or activity.\n* Practice self-care. It's important to take care of yourself, too, so you can be the best parent possible. Make sure to take breaks, get enough sleep, and eat healthy food.\n* Consult a pediatrician or therapist.

It starts by showing Jimmy McGill's (a.k.a.

In the first season of Better Call Saul, we see Jimmy start to become Saul Goodman, the lawyer who helps criminals hide their money. He becomes more and more ruthless as the season goes on. In the first season of Breaking Bad, we don't see Jimmy McGill at all. The first season of Breaking Bad shows Walter White's evolution from a meek high school chemistry teacher to a ruthless meth cook. The difference is that Jimmy's character transformation was already completed by the time the pilot of Breaking Bad aired.\n\nBetter Call Saul also has better writing than Breaking Bad.

    "instruction":"I\u2019m going to do bowling with my colleagues. Can you give me specific tips to kick their asses?\nExplain the technique please.\n",
    "output_1":"First off, if you don't want to kick their asses, just tell them you want to play for fun. They'll respect that.\n\nI have a basic technique that's pretty effective, but I'm not sure if it's the best or most universal. It's also very slow for a good player, so there may be other methods that work better for you.\n\nMy basic method is:\n\n* Use a two-handed grip.\n* Start the ball roll with your right hand first, so your left hand is on top.\n* Roll the ball straight, keeping your wrist stiff (not loose).\n* Finish the roll with your right hand, so your left hand is on top again.\n* Roll the ball towards the middle, as if you're aiming for the number 4-6 pins.\n* Release the ball when your arm is almost fully extended.\n* Keep your arm straight after releasing the ball.\n\nI've seen a lot of people roll the ball with their arm fully extended, and then it starts to veer left or right. I think this happens because the ball is still rolling when the arm starts to bend, so it tilts with the arm. By keeping your arm straight, the ball rolls straight until it hits the pins.\n\nTo add a curve to the ball, you can twist your wrist as you roll the ball. I've also seen people use a one-handed grip and then rotate their whole body to add a curve. This works for slow-speed games like duckpin bowling, but it's too slow for regular bowling.\n\nThe main thing to remember is to practice a lot. Practice your form in front of a mirror. Practice your release. Practice your accuracy. Practice your spare shooting. Practice your spares when you're throwing a strike. Practice your spares when you're throwing a gutter ball. Practice your spares when you're throwing a strike and a gutter ball. Practice your spares when you're throwing a gutter ball and a strike. Practice your spares when you're throwing a gutter ball and a gutter ball. Practice your spares when you're throwing a gutter ball and a gutter ball and a gutter ball.

The 10 frames are divided into 2 halves called 5 frames.\n\nIn bowling, the player with the ball is called the \"bowler\", while the others are known as \"pin-setters\". The bowler rolls the ball down the \"lane\" towards the pins, aiming to knock down as many as possible. After the ball has been rolled, the pin-setters place the pins back up, and the next bowler gets a chance.\n\nIn a game of bowling, the player with the lowest score after 10 frames wins. If there is a tie, then the game goes into an extra frame, and the first player to score in the extra frame wins.\n\nNow, here are some tips on how to win a game of bowling:\n\n1. Aim for the headpin: If you can knock down the head pin (the one directly in the middle), that is the best way to get a strike. A strike is when all ten pins are knocked down on the first roll.\n\n2. Use your wrist: When you release the ball, let your wrist turn over as you release the ball. This will help the ball spin, and will help it curve towards the pins.\n\n3. Use a lighter ball: If you are new to bowling, it is better to use a lighter ball. A heavier ball will be harder to control, and will be more likely to go into the gutter.\n\n4. Use your fingers: When you release the ball, make sure to use your fingers to release the ball. Don't let go of the ball with your palm.\n\n5. Use your body: When you are releasing the ball, use your whole body to help get the ball down the lane. Don't just use your arms.\n\n6. Use your legs: When you are releasing the ball, use your legs to help get the ball down the lane. Don't just stand there.\n\n7. Aim for the middle: If you are new to bowling, it is better to aim for the middle of the lane. If you aim too far to the left or right, you are more likely to go into the gutter.\n\n8. Don't try to be perfect: In bowling, it is more important to have a good average than to be perfect. If you are trying to be perfect, you will probably end up missing a lot of strikes.\n\n9. Use a lighter ball: If you are new to bowling, it is better to use a lighter ball. A heavier ball will be harder to control, and will be more likely to go into the gutter.\n\n10. Relax: In bowling, it is important to relax. If you are too tense, you will not be able to hit the pins.\n\n11. Have fun: In bowling, it is important to have fun. If you are not having fun, you will not be able to play your best game.\n",

    "instruction":"How do I make poached eggs at home?\n",
    "output_1":"Poached eggs are a great way to start your day. They are easy to make and a healthy alternative to fried eggs. All you need are a few simple ingredients and a little bit of time.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* Large eggs\n* Water\n* White vinegar (optional)\n* Salt and pepper\n\n## Preparation\n\n1. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. The water should be at least 2 to 3 inches deep. Add a splash of white vinegar and a pinch of salt. The vinegar will help the egg whites to coagulate, and the salt will add flavor. If you like your eggs extra runny, skip this step.\n2. Crack an egg into a ramekin or small bowl.\n3. Use a slotted spoon to gently slide the egg into the boiling water. Do not stir the water. Poach the egg for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the white is set and the yolk is still runny.\n4. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the egg to a plate. Season with salt and pepper, and serve.\n\n## Tips\n\n* If you\u2019re making multiple eggs, add them to the water one at a time.\n* You can serve your eggs on top of a slice of toast.\n* Try adding chopped chives, tomato, or spinach to your eggs.\n* To make deviled eggs, cut a slit in the top of the egg, and remove the yolk. Add mayonnaise and mustard to the yolk, and mix well. Pipe the mixture into the egg white, and sprinkle with paprika.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n\n* Serve your eggs with a slice of toast.\n* Top your eggs with chopped chives, tomato, or spinach.\n* Add some ham or bacon to your plate.\n* Drizzle some hollandaise sauce on top of your eggs.\n",

    "output_2":"Poached eggs are cooked in simmering water, so you'll need a non-stick skillet or frying pan.  You can make poached eggs in batches, or you can make one at a time.  Here's an easy method for cooking one at a time:\n\n* Crack one egg into a small bowl.  You'll use this bowl to slide the egg into the water.  If you crack the egg directly into the water, the shell will stick to the pan.\n* Add water to a non-stick skillet or frying pan.  Make sure the water doesn't touch the bottom of the pan.  You want about an inch of water in the pan, so add just enough so the water comes about halfway up the sides of the pan.  \n* Turn the heat on and let the water simmer until tiny bubbles start to form.  This will take about 2 minutes.  \n* Add a little butter, oil, or non-stick spray to the water.  This will keep the egg from sticking to the pan.  The butter or oil will also make the egg slide out of the pan easily.\n* When the water is simmering, slide the egg from the bowl into the water.  Make sure the egg is not touching the bottom of the pan.  If it does touch, it will break.\n* Cook the egg for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the white is firm.  If the egg starts to curl up at the edges, you can use a spoon to push the white down.\n* When the egg is done, use a slotted spoon to lift it out of the water.  If you want to lift it out before the white is firm, you can drain the egg on a paper towel.  If you let the egg cook until the white is firm, you can slide it right out of the pan onto a plate.\n\nHere's a method for cooking more than one poached egg at a time:\n\n* Add water to a non-stick skillet or frying pan.  Make sure the water doesn't touch the bottom of the pan.  You want about 2 inches of water in the pan.\n* Turn the heat on and let the water simmer until tiny bubbles start to form.  This will take about 2 minutes.\n* Add a little butter, oil, or non-stick spray to the water.  This will keep the eggs from sticking to the pan.\n* Crack all of the eggs into a bowl.  You can use a smaller bowl for one or two eggs, or a larger bowl for more eggs.\n* When the water is simmering, slide the eggs from the bowl into the water.  Make sure the eggs are not touching the bottom of the pan.\n* Cook the eggs for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the whites are firm.

    "instruction":"I have 350 examples that were annotated with binary labels by two different annotators. How do I compute inter-annotator agreement, including confidence interval?\n",
    "output_1":"There are several ways of measuring the level of agreement between two annotators. The simplest method is to compare their binary decisions directly:\n\n* Cohen\u2019s Kappa (which can be computed with the ```kappa()``` function in the IRR package in R)\n* Fleiss\u2019 Kappa\n* Simple Agreement\n\nHowever, as you note, it is possible that one annotator is more conservative than the other in their labeling (for example, one annotator may choose to label all examples as \"not relevant\", while the other annotator may choose to label as \"relevant\" even if there is only a weak signal for relevance). In this case, one annotator\u2019s label will be wrong more often than the other (because they are more conservative).\n\nTo account for this possibility, you can measure the agreement between the two annotators' labels in terms of whether both agree on whether an example is relevant, and the confidence of each annotator\u2019s decision. This is the approach used by the ```Cohen()``` function in the irr package in R, and also by the ```cohen_kappa()``` function in the irr package. The agreement measures are computed as follows:\n\n1. If both annotators agree that the example is relevant (or not relevant), then they are considered to agree. This is the \"certain\" category of agreement.\n2. If only one annotator labels the example as relevant (or not relevant), then they are considered to be uncertain.\n3. If both annotators disagree that the example is relevant (or not relevant), then they are considered to disagree.\n4. If one annotator labels the example as relevant and the other annotator labels the example as not relevant, then they are considered to disagree.\n\nThe final measure of agreement is calculated as the percentage of the \"certain\" cases (from step 1) divided by the total number of cases (from steps 1-4), and then adjusted for chance agreement.\n\nHere is a concrete example. Suppose you have the following data:\n\n```\n> cohen_example <- data.frame(x1 = c(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n",

Make sure that the wheels you are going to put snow chains on are off the ground and resting on a level surface.\n2. Make sure that your Honda CR-V is in neutral and set the parking brake. This will prevent the car from moving while you're trying to apply the snow chains.\n3. Remove any rocks or debris from around the tire you are about to put the snow chain on. This will help prevent any damage to your vehicle or the tire while you're putting on the snow chain.\n4. Check that your tires are fully inflated. You may need to let some air out if they are over-inflated. If you're unsure of the correct tire pressure for your vehicle, refer to the owner's manual or look for the pressure sticker on the inside of the driver's door.\n5. Make sure that you have all of the snow chains and other necessary equipment with you before you start putting them on. You will need a set of snow chains for each tire that you intend to put them on.\n6. Put on your gloves and ensure that you have something to stand on. You will be putting your hands very close to the moving parts of the wheel when putting on snow chains, so make sure that you are wearing gloves to protect your hands. You will also need something to stand on while you are putting on the snow chains, so that you don't have to bend over to put them on.\n\n## Applying snow chains to your Honda CR-V\n\n1. Place the snow chain over the tire and make sure that it is centered. If you are putting on two snow chains, make sure that both are centered over the tire.\n2. Push the snow chain up the tire until the hook on the end is facing upwards. Make sure that the hook is facing upwards so that you can attach the chain to the tire.\n3. Attach the chain to the tire by inserting the hook through the hole in the tire. You should hear a click when the hook is properly inserted into the hole. If you don't hear a click, make sure that you are inserting the hook into the correct hole.\n4. Tighten the chain by pulling on the strap that is attached to the hook. Pull on the strap until the chain is tight around the tire. You should hear a click when the chain is tight.\n5. Repeat the process for the other tire. Make sure that you are putting on the snow chains in the same direction for both tires so that they match up properly.\n6. Drive your Honda CR-V slowly until you get used to driving with snow chains. It may take a few minutes to get used to driving with snow chains on your tires, so go slow until you feel comfortable.\n7. Remove the snow chains when you no longer need them. Make sure that the hook is facing upwards before removing the chain from the tire.\n8. Repeat the process for the other tire.\n\n## Cleaning up after using snow chains\n\n1. Drive your Honda CR-V in reverse for a few minutes to loosen any dirt or snow that may be stuck to the tire.\n2. Remove the snow chains from your tires and put them away in their storage bag.\n3. Clean any dirt or snow off of the tire that you removed the snow chain from.\n4. Repeat the process for the other tire.\n5. Drive your Honda CR-V slowly for a few minutes to make sure that the tire is clean and free of any debris.\n6. Remove the snow chains from your tires and put them away in their storage bag.\n",

    "output_2":"You'll need to drive up a slight slope, stop, and put on the chains.\n\n## Drive up a slight slope\n\n1. Locate a slight slope. You can find a good place to put on chains by driving around until you find a slight slope that's mostly level but has a little bit of an incline. Look for a slope that's around 10% grade.\n2. Find a level area. Once you find the right slope, you'll want to drive up it until you reach a level area. This will allow you to stop in a level area without rolling back down the hill.\n3. Come to a stop. Once you reach the level area, come to a stop and put the car in park. Leave the car in drive if the car starts to roll back down the hill.\n4. Set the emergency brake. Set the emergency brake so the car won't roll down the hill.\n\n\n## Put on chains\n\n1. Set the chains. Spread out the chains on the ground around the tires. Put the chains in a crisscross pattern to help you see how to put them on.\n2. Put the chain on the tire. Grab the chains and place them around the tire. If you're putting them on the front wheels, you'll place the chains around the tire and over the top of the tire.\n3. Tighten the chain. Use the chain's tensioning tool to tighten the chain around the tire. You'll tighten the chain until the chains are snug around the tire.\n4. Move to the next tire. Repeat the process until you have the chains on all four tires.\n\n\n## Drive away\n\n1. Drive down the hill. When you're ready, drive down the hill. If the chains are on the right way, they should hold the car in place and you won't slide back up the hill.\n2. Drive off the chains. When you get to the bottom of the hill, drive off the chains. The chains should fall off as you drive away.\n3. Repeat the process if needed. If you need to put on snow chains again, you can repeat the process.\n",

    "instruction":"I have a bad credit history. Is there any way to get a credit card?\n",
    "output_1":"The answer is probably yes, but you may need to do some work to find it. There are several ways to get a credit card with bad credit. The first is to get a secured card. With a secured card, you put down a refundable security deposit (which becomes your credit limit) and pay your bills on time. After a while, you can try to get an unsecured card. Another option is to get a credit builder loan from your credit union. You make regular payments to the credit union, which then reports your on-time payments to the credit bureaus. This can help build or repair your credit. Finally, you can try to get a cosigned card. A cosigner agrees to pay your bills if you don't. This can help you get approved for a card, but it also means that the cosigner is responsible for your debt if you don't pay it.\n\nSo, to sum up, yes, it is possible to get a credit card with bad credit. You just may need to put in some effort to find the right card for you.\n",

    "output_2":"It is certainly possible to get a credit card, even if you have bad credit.  However, you may need to do some extra work to find a card, and you probably won't qualify for the best terms.\n\n## Types of credit cards for bad credit\n\nThere are two main categories of credit cards for people with bad credit:\n\n* **Guaranteed cards.** These cards are offered by the major credit card companies, but they are only available to people with bad credit.  The limits on these cards are usually very low, and they have high interest rates.  However, they are easy to get, and they can help rebuild your credit history.\n* **Secured cards.** These cards are backed by a cash deposit, which acts as collateral.  The limit on these cards is equal to your deposit, and you can often get a card even if your credit is bad.  However, they don't help rebuild your credit, because you don't use them to make payments.  You can usually convert a secured card to a regular unsecured card after a year or so.\n\n## Getting a credit card with bad credit\n\nThere are a few things you can do to make it easier to get a credit card, even if you have bad credit:\n\n* Get your credit report.  You're entitled to a free copy of your credit report every year.  Make sure it's accurate, and fix any mistakes.\n* Know your FICO score.  The FICO score is a number between 300 and 850 that measures your creditworthiness.  The higher your score, the easier it will be to get a credit card.\n* Look for pre-qualified offers.  Many credit card companies will send pre-qualified offers to people with bad credit.  These offers are based on your credit report, so they're a good indication of whether you'll be approved for a card.\n* Apply for a secured card.  As mentioned above, secured cards are backed by a cash deposit.  This makes them easy to get, even if your credit is bad.  Once you've used the card for a year or so, you can usually convert it to an unsecured card.\n* Find a co-signer.  If you can't get approved for a card on your own, you may be able to get one with a co-signer.  The co-signer agrees to be responsible for your debt if you default, so it's important to choose someone you trust.\n\n## Applying for a credit card with bad credit\n\nThe process of applying for a credit card with bad credit is pretty much the same as for a regular card.  You'll need to fill out an application, and you may be asked to provide proof of income.  The credit card company will check your credit report, and they may also ask for a cash deposit.  If you're approved, you'll get your card in the mail within a few weeks.\n",

    "instruction":"How would you design a spam filter?\n",
    "output_1":"A spam filter is a program or service that aims to identify and sort out as spam undesired or unsolicited messages that were sent to the user without his\/her consent.\n\n## Spam filtering techniques\n\nThere are various techniques that can be used in order to create a spam filter. Below are some of them.\n\n* **Text analysis** \u2014 by checking the text of the email for keywords that are known to be associated with spam. For example, the word \"Viagra\" is often used in spam emails.\n* **Sender analysis** \u2014 by checking whether the sender of the email is in a list of known spammers.\n* **Recipient analysis** \u2014 by checking whether the recipient of the email has previously reported emails from the sender as spam.\n* **Sender reputation** \u2014 by checking the reputation of the sender, which is determined by how many other people have reported emails from the sender as spam.\n* **Blacklists** \u2014 by checking whether the email address of the sender is in a list of known spammers.\n* **Whitelists** \u2014 by checking whether the email address of the sender is in a list of known non-spammers.\n* **Heuristics** \u2014 by checking for patterns in the email that are associated with spam, but which cannot be easily detected by text analysis or sender analysis. For example, a high density of links in the email body might be a sign that the email is spam.\n* **Machine learning** \u2014 by using algorithms that learn from existing data in order to identify spam emails. This can be used in conjunction with other techniques, such as text analysis or sender analysis.\n\n## Challenges in designing a spam filter\n\nThere are several challenges that need to be addressed when designing a spam filter.\n\n* **False positives** \u2014 the filter may mistakenly classify legitimate emails as spam. This can be caused by the filter's inability to correctly identify the sender's reputation or by the use of keywords that are also present in legitimate emails.\n* **False negatives** \u2014 the filter may miss spam emails. This can be caused by the use of techniques that are not very effective in filtering spam, such as text analysis or sender analysis.\n* **Spam filters as a security threat** \u2014 by relying on blacklists of known spammers, the spam filter may block legitimate emails from unknown senders. This is because it is difficult to keep these lists up-to-date and they may include legitimate email addresses.\n* **Spam filters as a privacy threat** \u2014 by relying on sender reputation, the spam filter may disclose the recipient's email address to third parties. This is because spam filters often report the email addresses of legitimate senders to other spam filters in order to build up a sender reputation.\n* **Spam filters as a scalability threat** \u2014 by relying on sender reputation, the spam filter may require a large amount of data in order to train its algorithms. This is because spam filters often need to build up a sender reputation for all email addresses in order to filter spam effectively.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, designing a spam filter is a complex task that requires the use of various techniques and the consideration of various challenges.\n",

    "output_2":"A spam filter is a program that attempts to identify unsolicited bulk email (junk mail or UBE), email spam, and email viruses. Incoming emails are checked to determine if they contain characteristics of spam. This is accomplished using a variety of filtering mechanisms such as blacklists, whitelists, challenge-response systems, and content analysis. The goal of the spam filter is to identify and block spam while allowing legitimate email to pass through.\n\nHow do spam filters work?\n\nThere are two basic types of spam filters, blacklist and whitelist. Blacklist filters block email from known spammers, while whitelist filters allow email from known good senders.\n\nBlacklist filters:\n\n* Scan the email headers (the information that appears above the actual email message) for words or phrases commonly used by spammers.\n* Check the email sender's address against a list of known spammers.\n* Check the email content for key words and phrases commonly used by spammers.\n\nWhitelist filters:\n\n* Scan the email headers for words or phrases commonly used by legitimate email senders.\n* Check the email sender's address against a list of known good email senders.\n* Check the email content for key words and phrases commonly used by legitimate email senders.\n\nHow effective are spam filters?\n\nSpam filters are not 100% effective. Some legitimate email will be incorrectly identified as spam and blocked by the filter. Some spam will slip through the filter. It's a constant battle between the spammers, who are constantly coming up with new ways to get around spam filters, and the filter developers, who are constantly updating their filters to keep up with the spammers.\n\nHow can I tell if an email has been filtered as spam?\n\nIf you receive an email that you think should not have been filtered as spam, you can try resending the email with a different subject line or body text. If the email still gets filtered as spam, you may want to contact the sender and ask them to add your email address to their whitelist.\n",

    "output_1":"The world is awash with water.\n\nThe planet is composed of 71% water, most of it in the oceans.\n\nThere's enough fresh water for everyone on the planet if it was distributed evenly. The problem is that most of the fresh water is locked up in ice caps and glaciers. Even the water in rivers and lakes is only a tiny fraction of the total fresh water available.\n\nAbout 70% of the world's fresh water is stored in ice caps and glaciers. Another 30% is in underground aquifers, rivers, and lakes.\n\nThat leaves only 0.3% as accessible surface water, which is what we normally think of as \"drinking water\".\n\nIf the world's population doubled, it would take an additional 40% of water to provide everyone with the same amount of water as is used today.\n\nThis means that as the world's population grows, the available water supply will shrink.\n\nIf the world's population continues to grow at the current rate, we'll run out of water in about 50 years.\n\nThe good news is that there are ways to make more fresh water available. Desalination plants can turn seawater into drinking water. Rainwater collection systems can capture rain from roofs and divert it to storage tanks.\n\nSo while the world doesn't have enough water to provide everyone with the same amount as today, there are ways to make more water available.\n",

    "output_2":"While there are many competing demands on water resources, and many areas of the world facing water scarcity, there is enough fresh water available globally to meet everyone's basic needs.  However, ensuring equitable access to water, and managing water resources to prevent scarcity and pollution, are major challenges.\n\n## How much water is available?\n\nAccording to the United Nations, Earth's total water volume is approximately  331,000,000 cubic kilometers.  Of that, two-thirds is salt water, leaving about  106,400,000 cubic kilometers of fresh water.  However, only a small fraction of that is readily accessible.  The water in lakes and rivers accounts for about  0.3% of the total water available.  Another  0.3% is groundwater that is easily accessible through aquifers.\n\n## How much water do people need?\n\nThe United Nations recommends that everyone have access to at least  50 liters (about 13 US gallons) of water per person per day for drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene.  For agricultural and industrial purposes, the recommended amount is  200 liters (about 52 US gallons) per person per day.  That total of  250 liters (about 55 US gallons) per person per day is often used as a benchmark for measuring water scarcity.  However, meeting basic needs varies depending on climate and lifestyle.  In temperate regions with plentiful water sources, people can get by with as little as  20 liters (about 5 US gallons) per day.  In arid regions, people need much more.  For example, in the Sahara Desert, people need  300 liters (about 80 US gallons) of water per day just to survive.\n\n## How much water is polluted?\n\nIt's hard to know how much water is polluted, since so much water is contaminated, and there is no single definition of \"polluted.\"  The UN estimates that about  2.1 billion people (29% of the global population) live in areas of water stress, and that  4.1 billion people (57% of the global population) live in areas affected by water scarcity.  These figures include both physical scarcity (not enough water to meet basic needs) and economic scarcity (people cannot afford water, or it is not safely available).  In addition, about  2.3 billion people (32% of the global population) lack adequate sanitation.  That means they don't have access to safe, clean water for drinking and personal hygiene.  They rely on unsanitary sources of water, which can easily be contaminated with pathogens.\n\n## Where is the water?\n\nMost of the fresh water on Earth is stored in ice and snow, mainly in Antarctica and Greenland.  The rest is mostly underground, in aquifers.  Only  3% of the Earth's fresh water is in lakes and rivers.  Of that, only  0.3% is easily accessible.\n\n## How is the water being used?\n\nAbout  68% of the world's fresh water is used for agriculture,  21% is used by industry, and  11% is used by households.  This distribution varies significantly between countries, with the heaviest users being in developed countries and the lightest users in developing countries.  In developed countries, about  80% of fresh water is used for agriculture and industry, and  20% is used by households.  In developing countries, about  50% of fresh water is used by households, and  50% is split between agriculture and industry.\n\n## Where is the water going?\n\nAbout  2.1 trillion liters (about  541 trillion US gallons) of fresh water are used each day by humans.  Of that,  1.1 trillion liters (about  275 trillion US gallons) are used by households,  400 billion liters (about  100 billion US gallons) are used by industry, and  800 billion liters (about  200 billion US gallons) are used by agriculture.\n\n## How much water do we use?\n\nThe amount of water used by humans varies significantly between countries, with the heaviest users being in developed countries and the lightest users in developing countries.  In developed countries, the average person uses about  350 liters (about 92 US gallons) of water per day.  In developing countries, the average person uses about  100 liters (about 26 US gallons) of water per day.\n",

    "output_1":"The longest word in the English language is an unpronounceable sequence of letters called antsylexia, which is defined as the inability to determine whether one is reading or writing. It comes from the Greek words anti, meaning against, and lexia, meaning word. The word has a length of 56 letters, making it the longest word in the English language.\n\nThere are also some shorter words that are just as unpronounceable as the longest one. These words are typographical symbols, which are characters used in printing and typesetting to perform special functions, such as indicating a new paragraph, a change in the font, or a footnote. For example, there are words such as interrobang, which is a combination of the words \u201cinterrogation point\u201d and \u201cexclamation point\u201d, and the character itself. Another example is the word ligature, which is a combination of two letters into one character.

Baking soda absorbs bad odors and can help freshen the air in your apartment.\n\nIf you are referring to more severe odors, such as from a pet, try these steps instead:\n\n* Place an open box of baking soda in the room that smells the worst. Replace the box every few days, if necessary.\n* Spray Febreze in the room.

I\u2019d recommend the Coway AP-1512HH Mighty, which is rated #1 on Wirecutter and is available on Amazon.  \n\n## Essential oil diffuser\n\nThis works the same way as an air purifier but can also help with smell and mood.  They\u2019re also reasonably priced and available on Amazon.  I recommend the VicTsing Essential Oil Diffuser Humidifier, which is rated #1 on Amazon.\n\n## Houseplants\n\nThis is another inexpensive solution that works fairly well and has the added benefit of improving your home\u2019s appearance.  There are many good options, but I\u2019d recommend one or more of the following:\n\n- Spider plant: easy to grow and maintain, good at removing formaldehyde from the air.\n- Boston fern: easy to grow and maintain, great at removing formaldehyde and benzene from the air.\n- English ivy: easy to grow and maintain, great at removing formaldehyde and xylene from the air.\n- Snake plant: easy to grow and maintain, good at removing formaldehyde and xylene from the air.\n\n## Professional cleaning\n\nThis is probably the most expensive option but can be worth it if you have a serious problem.  It\u2019s also a good idea to have your home professionally cleaned every few months anyway, so this could be part of your regular routine.  If you go this route, I\u2019d recommend booking with TaskRabbit or hiring a professional cleaner through Thumbtack.\n\n## Professional odor removal\n\nThis is probably the most expensive option and is only necessary if you have a very serious odor problem.  It\u2019s also worth trying some of the other solutions first.  If you go this route, I\u2019d recommend booking with TaskRabbit or hiring a professional cleaner through Thumbtack.\n",

    "instruction":"I'm thinking of taking my family to Disney World, but I'm not sure when the best time of year is. Can you recommend a time of year that is inexpensive but not too crowded?\n",
    "output_1":"Disney World is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. As a result, the price of a vacation to Disney World can vary significantly depending on the time of year.\n\nThe least expensive time of year to visit Disney World is generally between mid-January and mid-February. During this time, hotel prices are at their lowest and the parks are typically less crowded. However, this is also the time of year when the weather is coldest, and Florida tends to experience more rainfall than at other times of year.\n\nIf you're willing to pay a little more for your vacation, but still want to avoid peak season prices and crowds, consider visiting Disney World between mid-August and mid-September. During this time, hotel prices are slightly higher than during the off-season, but still lower than peak season prices. The weather is generally warm and dry, with average high temperatures in the mid-80s (30s).\n\nIf you're willing to pay peak season prices, but don't mind the crowds, consider visiting Disney World between mid-June and mid-August. During this time, hotel prices are at their highest, but the weather is typically warm and dry, with average high temperatures in the low 90s (30s).\n",

    "output_2":"Sure, here are some recommendations:\n\n-  If you want to avoid the crowds, but still want good weather, consider going in late August or early September. It's after the summer rush, but before the holiday season.\n-  If you want to save money, go during the \"value\" season, which is typically mid-January through mid-February, or mid-August through early October. However, you'll have to deal with cooler weather in January and February, and potentially rainy weather in August and September.\n-  If you want to avoid the heat and humidity, go in late February, March, or early April. It can still be crowded during spring break, though, so call ahead to check.\n-  If you want to experience Halloween and Christmas at Disney, go in October and November, respectively. You'll have to deal with crowds, though, especially around Halloween and Thanksgiving.\n\nI hope this helps! Feel free to let me know if you have any other questions.\n",

    "instruction":"3 paragraph essay on the pros and cons of fast food\n",
    "output_1":"The following is a pro-con essay on the topic of fast food. \nFast food is the food that is served quickly at restaurants or stands. It is usually pre-prepared and kept warm until it is bought. The most common fast foods are burgers, pizza, hot dogs, tacos, fried chicken, and french fries.\nPros of Fast Food\n* Cost-effective: Fast food is a cost-effective option for people who want to eat out, but don't have a lot of money to spend. Fast food restaurants usually have low prices for their meals, making it possible for people on a budget to enjoy a meal at a restaurant.\n* Convenient: Fast food is convenient because it is easy to find and easy to eat. Many fast food restaurants are located in busy areas where people need to eat quickly, such as malls and airports. The food is also designed to be eaten quickly, so people can eat and leave.\n* Portable: Fast food is portable because it is easy to carry around. People can take their fast food with them, which makes it convenient if they are on the go.\n* Tasty: Fast food is tasty because it is usually fried and contains a lot of salt and sugar. This combination of ingredients makes fast food taste good to many people.\nCons of Fast Food\n* Unhealthy: Fast food is unhealthy because it is high in fat, sugar, and sodium. These nutrients are bad for people's health, so eating fast food regularly can cause obesity and other health problems.\n* Unbalanced diet: Fast food is unbalanced because it is usually only one type of food, such as burgers or tacos. This can lead to nutritional deficiencies if people only eat fast food and don't eat other foods.\n* Boring: Fast food is boring because it is the same thing every time. People who eat fast food often eat the same meals over and over again, which can get old quickly.\n* Slow service: Fast food restaurants are usually busy, so it can take a long time for customers to get their orders. This can be frustrating for people who are in a hurry.\n* Bad for the environment: Fast food packaging is bad for the environment because it is usually made of plastic. This plastic takes a long time to break down, so it stays in the environment for a long time.\n",

    "output_1":"The U.S. healthcare system is very complicated, and is constantly changing. \nThis answer is meant to provide a general overview of the system as of 2018, but it should not be considered comprehensive or current. \nA very important resource for learning about the U.S. healthcare system is [KFF's State Health Facts site](http:\/\/www.statehealthfacts.org\/comparemap), which allows you to compare healthcare outcomes across different states.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe United States does not have a nationalized healthcare system, like most other developed nations. \nInstead, healthcare in the U.S. is primarily provided by private companies, with varying amounts of government regulation. \nHealthcare is primarily financed through a combination of insurance and out-of-pocket payments. \nBecause of this, access to healthcare is very variable, depending on your income, insurance, and location.\n\n## Insurance\n\nHealth insurance in the U.S. can be categorized into two types: employer-sponsored insurance (such as an HMO or PPO) and individual insurance (such as through the Health Insurance Marketplace). \nAlmost all Americans are required to have health insurance, which is enforced through the individual mandate. \nSome low-income individuals can qualify for Medicaid. \nThe elderly are covered by Medicare.\n\n## Delivery\n\nMost Americans receive care through private insurance plans, such as HMOs or PPOs. \nIn general, these plans pay for care at in-network providers at a fixed rate. \nIndividuals with Medicare or Medicaid generally have to use providers that accept their insurance.\n\n## Funding\n\nInsurance typically covers most of the costs of healthcare. \nPremiums are paid through insurance plans. \nFor low-income individuals, Medicaid pays premiums. \nIndividuals without insurance typically pay out of pocket.\n\n## Research\n\nMuch of the basic research in the United States is funded by the federal government. \nHowever, most clinical research is funded by private entities. \nMost clinical trials are conducted by pharmaceutical companies.\n",

    "output_2":"It varies widely by state, and it\u2019s complex and controversial.  You could write a book about it.  But here\u2019s the short version:\n\nThere are two major types of health insurance in the USA:\n\n*  \u201cPublic\u201d:  This is insurance provided by government, for example, Medicare and Medicaid.  Some people get this insurance because they\u2019re poor, and some because they\u2019re old.\n\n*  \u201cPrivate\u201d:  This is insurance bought from for-profit companies or non-profits.  This is what most people have.\n\nMost people get health insurance through their job.  This means they pay for it through \u201cpremiums\u201d which are automatically deducted from their paycheck.  Or the employer pays the premiums directly.  Some people pay for their own health insurance, either through their employer or directly to an insurance company.\n\nBut there are a lot of people who don\u2019t have health insurance.  Some are poor.  Some are middle class, but don\u2019t think they need it.  Some are self-employed, and don\u2019t have access to group insurance.\n\nIt\u2019s controversial because some people think everyone should have health insurance, but the government doesn\u2019t make everyone buy it.  They think everyone should buy it, and the government should help pay for it for poor people.  That\u2019s called \u201cuniversal health care\u201d.  Most other countries have universal health care.

A lower teacher-student ratio and higher teacher salaries indicate a stronger commitment to education. Third, you'll want to look at the percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.

Take a few minutes each day to practice mindfulness exercises, such as deep breathing or meditation.

    "instruction":"What are the most effective ways to deal with stress?\n",
    "output_1":"Stress is a part of life, and trying to avoid it entirely is impossible. You have to find ways to cope with it, or it will control your life. Here are some suggestions for how to deal with stress in a healthy way:\n\n*   **Recognize the signs.** Stress affects everyone differently, so it's important to recognize how it affects you. You might notice physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches, or you might notice that you're more irritable than usual. Once you know what stress looks like for you, you can take steps to cope with it.\n*   **Exercise.** Exercise releases endorphins, which are chemicals in your brain that make you feel good. It also helps you sleep better, which is important because sleep deprivation is a common side effect of stress. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise every day. If you're really stressed out, you might want to aim for an hour.\n*   **Practice mindfulness.** Mindfulness is all about being present in the moment, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. Try meditating for 10 minutes every day. Or, if you're not into meditation, you can practice mindfulness by taking a walk and paying attention to your surroundings.\n*   **Get plenty of sleep.** When you're stressed, it's easy to stay up late watching TV or surfing the web. But getting enough sleep is essential for managing stress. Aim for at least 7 hours a night, and try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.\n*   **Eat a healthy diet.** When you're stressed, you might find yourself reaching for sugary or processed foods. But those foods will only make you feel worse. Instead, eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, because they'll just make you more jittery.\n*   **Spend time with friends and family.** Laughing with loved ones is a great way to relieve stress. Plan a night out with your friends, or invite your family over for dinner. Spending time with people you care about will make you feel happier and less stressed.\n*   **Practice self-care.** Self-care is all about taking care of yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally. Get a massage, take a bubble bath, or read a good book. Do whatever makes you feel relaxed and refreshed.\n*   **Practice healthy habits.** Smoking, drinking alcohol, and doing drugs will only make your stress worse. If you're struggling with addiction, seek help from a qualified professional.\n*   **Practice good communication.** Stress can make it harder to communicate with other people. If you're feeling stressed, try to practice good communication skills, like listening carefully and expressing yourself clearly.\n*   **Simplify your life.** Stress often comes from trying to juggle too many responsibilities. Make a list of your priorities and trim anything that isn't essential.\n*   **Learn to say no.** It's okay to say no when you're asked to do something that will stress you out. Saying no can be hard, but it's important to learn how to do it without feeling guilty.\n*   **Let go of perfectionism.** Perfectionism is a huge source of stress. You'll never feel like you've done enough, and you'll always be dissatisfied with your performance. Try to let go of the idea that anything has to be perfect.\n*   **Avoid triggers.** If there's something that always stresses you out, avoid it if you can. For example, if you know that arguing with your spouse will make you feel anxious, try to avoid arguments.\n*   **Let go of guilt.** Guilt is a wasted emotion. If you've done something wrong, acknowledge it and learn from it. But don't let guilt keep you stuck in the past.\n*   **Practice forgiveness.** Holding on to anger and resentment is just another way of letting stress control your life. If you need to forgive someone, do it as soon as possible.\n*   **Practice gratitude.** Gratitude is the opposite of stress. When you're grateful for what you have, you can't be stressed about what you don't have. Make a habit of writing down 3 things you're grateful for every day.\n*   **Ask for help.** It can be hard to admit that you're struggling, but asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. If you're feeling overwhelmed, ask your friends and family for support. They'll be happy to help if they can.\n*   **Practice positive self-talk.** When you're stressed, it's easy to say negative things to yourself. But negative self-talk will only make you feel worse. Instead, practice positive self-talk. Remind yourself that you're doing the best you can, and that everything will be okay.\n*   **P\n",

    "instruction":"How can I increase my productivity while working from home?\n",
    "output_1":"Working from home can be a great way to boost your productivity, but it can also be a major distraction. Here are a few tips to help you stay focused and productive while working from home:\n\n* Set up a dedicated workspace. Having a designated workspace will help you establish a routine and stay focused. Choose a quiet room in your home with good lighting and a comfortable chair. If possible, set up a desk with all the supplies you need for your work, such as a computer, printer, and phone.\n\n* Create a schedule. Just because you work from home doesn't mean you should skip the 9 to 5. Setting a schedule will help you stay focused and productive. Start by creating a daily to-do list and sticking to it. Be sure to schedule breaks and time for meals.\n\n* Stay connected. Working from home can make it easy to become isolated. Make sure you stay connected with your coworkers and clients by scheduling regular video meetings. If possible, try to get out of the house once a week and meet colleagues in person.\n\n* Take care of yourself. It's easy to get caught up in your work and neglect your health when you work from home. Make sure you take time for exercise and relaxation. Get enough sleep, eat healthy meals, and take breaks throughout the day.\n\nBy following these tips, you can increase your productivity and enjoy the benefits of working from home.\n",

    "output_2":"As a software engineer, I\u2019ve been working from home full-time for the past two years. Here are a few tips that have helped me:\n\n* Have a separate space to work. This can be a dedicated home office or just a corner of a room. Having a designated space will help you mentally separate work from the rest of your life. It will also make it easier to focus when you\u2019re working, since you won\u2019t be constantly distracted by things like the TV or your couch.\n\n* Set a regular schedule. When you work from home, it\u2019s easy to get distracted and let your work day spill over into the evening or weekend. By setting a regular schedule, you can keep your work-life balance in check and ensure that you get your work done during normal business hours.\n\n* Stick to your schedule. Once you\u2019ve set a schedule, stick to it as much as possible. This will help you stay productive and avoid feeling burned out. If you need to adjust your schedule occasionally, that\u2019s fine. But try to keep it as consistent as possible.\n\n* Get out of the house. It\u2019s easy to feel cooped up when you work from home, especially if you don\u2019t have a dedicated home office. Make sure you get out of the house at least once a day, even if it\u2019s just for a walk around the block. This will help you stay motivated and productive.\n\n* Get dressed for work. It may seem counterintuitive to get dressed when you\u2019re working from home, but it will actually help you stay productive. When you get dressed for work, you\u2019re putting on your \u201cwork face\u201d and telling yourself it\u2019s time to get serious. It also helps you psychologically separate work from the rest of your life.\n\n* Stay connected. When you work from home, it\u2019s easy to feel isolated. Make sure you stay connected with your coworkers by chatting online, joining video calls, or grabbing coffee together. This will help you stay motivated and feel like part of a team.\n\n* Take breaks. When you work from home, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in your work and forget to take breaks. Make sure you take regular breaks to stretch, get some fresh air, and recharge. This will help you stay focused and productive throughout the day.\n\n* Unplug after work. When you work from home, it\u2019s easy to feel like you\u2019re always on call. Make sure you unplug after work and dedicate time to your family and friends. This will help you stay sane and keep your work life in balance.\n",

    "instruction":"What should I buy my son for his seventh birthday?\n",
    "output_1":"I have two kids and I know it is not easy to buy toys. Kids have a lot of choices and they can be quite picky about what they want. I have bought many toys and most of them are forgotten soon. Some toys get used for few days and then they just get added to the collection of toys. Kids like to play with different things at different times. There are some toys which are popular and kids have seen in ads and they ask their parents to buy it for them. \n\nHere are few things you can consider when you buy toys for your son:\n\n1. Age of the kid: When you are in the store, you should look at the recommended age for the toy. Some toys are designed for kids of a particular age group. For example, a Lego set is designed for kids of 5 years and above. If you buy a Lego set for your 3 year old son, he may not be able to assemble the set by himself.\n2. Interest of the kid: Try to understand what interests your son. What is he currently playing at home? What toys does he play with at his friend's house? What does he see in ads and he wants you to buy? What toys does he likes to play with when you visit a toy store? These are some questions you can ask to understand what interests your kid. You should be able to guess what he would like to play with. It is not necessary that he would tell you what he wants.\n3. Budget: You should have a budget in mind when you go shopping. There are many toys that look good in the store but they can be expensive. Make sure you buy toys that you can afford. You can find many toys in reasonable price if you look around. \n4. Toy safety: Make sure you buy toys that are safe. Avoid toys that have small parts that can be swallowed by the kid. Try to avoid toys that have sharp edges. Try to buy toys that are durable and can be used for a long time.\n5. Gift wrap: Some stores provide gift wrapping service. You can ask the store to wrap the gift. You can also wrap the gift at home. It is a nice gesture to wrap the gift and give it to your son. \n6. Gift card: You can buy a gift card for a store where your son likes to shop. You can also buy a gift card for a movie theater. Gift cards are always useful and kids like to buy stuff with them. \n",

I have a seven-year-old, and I\u2019ve found that the best things to get him are things that help develop his creativity, like drawing supplies or games.  I\u2019ve also found that things that are fun to do with other people are really good, like board games.

    "output_1":"Socialization is a complex process that is influenced by many factors, including family structure, socioeconomic status, culture, and individual personalities. Some children develop social skills more quickly than others. At 6 years old, your daughter may simply be a bit young to have developed friendships that she considers meaningful.\n\nHere are some things you can do to help your daughter make friends:\n\n* Encourage your daughter to join a club or team, such as soccer or gymnastics. Participating in structured activities with other children her age can help her develop social skills and make friends.\n* Encourage your daughter to invite a classmate over to play. Having a friend over to the house gives her a chance to practice playing together and make plans for future playdates.\n* Encourage your daughter to join a playgroup or playdate group. Playgroups are a great way for children to play together and learn social skills.\n* Encourage your daughter to make eye contact and say hello to other children. This simple act can help her develop friendships.\n* Encourage your daughter to invite her friends over to play. This can help her practice her social skills and make new friends.\n* Talk to your daughter about her feelings.

    "instruction":"What are the main differences between Python and JavaScript programming languages?\n",
    "output_1":"Python and JavaScript are both powerful, widely used programming languages. Both languages have their pros and cons, and it ultimately comes down to personal preference which one is better for a particular use case. Here are some of the main differences between Python and JavaScript:\n\n* **Syntax:** Python uses whitespace to denote blocks and indentation to denote code within blocks, while JavaScript uses curly braces. This can be a source of confusion for beginners in both languages.\n* **Type system:** Python is dynamically typed, while JavaScript is weakly typed. This means that in Python, variables don't need to be declared with a specific type, and their type is determined at runtime. In JavaScript, variables are also dynamically typed, but their type can change over the course of execution. This can lead to unexpected behaviour if you aren't careful.\n* **Style:** Python uses a lot of parentheses and JavaScript doesn't. This can make Python code look more cluttered, but it also makes it easier to read.\n* **Libraries:** Python has a wider range of libraries available than JavaScript, particularly when it comes to scientific and numerical computing. However, JavaScript has more libraries available for web development.\n* **Performance:** In general, Python is slower than JavaScript, but this varies depending on the specific code. For example, Python is better at doing intensive number crunching, while JavaScript is better at manipulating the DOM.\n\nIn summary, Python and JavaScript are both powerful programming languages, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. Choose the one that best suits your needs and be sure to take advantage of its unique features.\n",

    "output_2":"Python and JavaScript are both high-level, general-purpose programming languages. Here are some key differences:\n\n*  **Design philosophy:** Python is a design philosophy language, while JavaScript is an implementation language. Python emphasizes readability and uses indentation to indicate block structure, while JavaScript uses curly braces.\n*  **Runtime environments:** Python runs on CPython, PyPy, Jython, IronPython, and Stackless Python. JavaScript runs in web browsers and Node.js.\n*  **Data types:** Python has strings, numbers, and lists; JavaScript has strings, numbers, arrays, and objects.\n*  **Garbage collection:** Python uses reference counting for memory management; JavaScript uses a garbage collector.\n*  **Libraries:** The standard Python library is much larger than the standard JavaScript library.\n\nThese differences make Python and JavaScript well-suited for different types of programs. Python is commonly used for data science and numerical computing, while JavaScript is used for web development and client-side scripting.\n",

The key to successful conflict resolution is understanding the underlying causes of the conflict and addressing them head-on. Here are some strategies for effective conflict resolution in the workplace:\n\n* Identify the Root Causes: It is important to identify the underlying causes of the conflict and address them head-on. This may require some digging to uncover the root causes. For example, if two employees are constantly arguing, the cause may be a misunderstanding or a difference in opinion.\n* Address the Conflict Head-On: Once the root causes have been identified, it is important to address the conflict head-on. This may involve holding a meeting with the parties involved to discuss the issue and find a resolution.\n* Seek Help From HR: If the conflict persists, it may be necessary to seek help from HR or a mediator. HR professionals are trained in conflict resolution and can help facilitate a resolution.\n* Document the Resolution: It is important to document the resolution in writing and have all parties sign off on it. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the resolution is enforceable.\n* Monitor the Resolution: It is important to monitor the resolution to ensure that it is working. If necessary, adjustments can be made to further resolve the conflict.\n\nThese strategies can help resolve workplace conflicts and create a positive, productive work environment.

While there are many different types of school districts, most are governed by a school board that is elected by the residents of the district.\n\nIn the United States, the government does work hard to increase education standards. However, there are many factors that can affect the quality of a school district, including:\n\n* The demographics of the district, including the racial makeup and socioeconomic status of the population.\n* The availability of resources, such as funding and technology.\n* The quality of the teachers and administrators.\n* The involvement of the community, including parents and businesses.\n\nAs a result, some school districts may have higher standards than others, even if the government is doing its best to ensure that all students receive a quality education.\n\nIn addition, the government does not always have control over the quality of schools in a district. For example, some districts may be located in areas with lower property values, which can limit the amount of funding that the district receives. Similarly, some districts may have a higher proportion of students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, which can also affect the amount of funding that the district receives.\n\nUltimately, the quality of a school district depends on many factors, both within and outside of the government's control.\n",

    "output_2":"In the US, public schools are funded by local property taxes.  This means that the school district for a given area is determined by local property tax rates, and those are set by local political processes.  In many areas, there is a high correlation between income levels and property tax rates, so you often see high property tax rates in affluent neighborhoods, and low property tax rates in poorer neighborhoods.  This is true even if the wealthier neighborhoods don't want to pay higher property taxes, because they know the tax dollars will go to support poorer kids' schools.\n\nThe problem is that, by this method, the quality of the school system in a given area is determined by local politics, not education standards.  So you often see a high-quality school district with a lot of money and good facilities, and a poorer district with less money and poor facilities.  But the poorer district isn't necessarily a bad district - it just has less money to spend on schools.\n\nThe solution is to fund schools through the state or federal government, instead of through local property taxes.  This would eliminate the problem of wealthy neighborhoods paying higher property taxes while poor neighborhoods pay lower property taxes.  It would also eliminate the problem of wealthy school districts using their tax dollars to support poorer school districts.  The problem with this system is that it would require the government to take a much more active role in education, which would be politically difficult.  It would also require the government to redistribute money from wealthier school districts to poorer school districts, which is also politically difficult.\n",

If there were special diets that required more effort, I might also ask them to let me know in advance so I can prepare.\n* In a more professional context, for example when organizing a conference dinner. Here, I might send an email to the attendee list, or ask the organizer, or even post a survey online.\n\nIn both situations, the context makes it obvious that it is appropriate to ask about special diets.\n\nIn general, if you are not sure whether it is appropriate to ask, you could try one of the following:\n\n* Offer general options, and then follow up with specific questions if the other party shows interest. For example, when serving a meal, you could ask \"Would you like a vegetarian option?\"\n* Ask the person you are concerned about directly. For example, you could say \"I'm not sure whether there is anything that you can't eat. Can you let me know?\"\n* Ask someone who knows the other party well.

This is due to the changing values of societies over time, and the increasing awareness of the harmful effects of these behaviours and activities. One such example is the acceptance of slavery in many societies, which is now considered unacceptable and illegal in most countries around the world. Slavery is considered unacceptable today because we are increasingly aware of its harmful effects on both the enslaved individuals and society at large. Enslaved individuals are deprived of their basic human rights, and are subjected to physical and mental abuse. Slavery also has harmful effects on society, as it fuels inequality and injustice, and undermines the values of freedom and equality. Another example is the acceptance of sexism and gender discrimination in many societies, which is now considered unacceptable and illegal in most countries around the world. Sexism and gender discrimination are considered unacceptable today because we are increasingly aware of the harmful effects of these behaviours and activities on both women and society at large.

    "output_1":"Single-use plastic bottles can have significant environmental and human health effects. One of the main environmental effects is plastic pollution. Plastic bottles are made of petroleum, and when they are not recycled, they can take hundreds of years to degrade. As a result, plastic bottles are a major source of ocean pollution. Every year, millions of plastic bottles end up in the ocean, where they can harm marine life and contaminate seafood.\n\nIn addition to plastic pollution, single-use plastic bottles can also contribute to climate change. The production of plastic bottles generates large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. These gases are emitted both during the production of the plastic bottles and when they are incinerated.\n\nIn terms of human health, single-use plastic bottles can pose a risk to human health through two main mechanisms. First, plastic bottles can leach chemicals into the water or beverages that they contain, such as bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates. These chemicals can then be ingested by humans when they consume the contaminated water or beverage. Second, single-use plastic bottles can transfer bacteria from one person to another, making them a potential source of infection. For example, if someone coughs or sneezes into a plastic bottle, the bacteria from their respiratory secretions can be transmitted to other people who drink from the same bottle.\n",

Every year, hundreds of millions of plastic bottles end up in the ocean, where they can harm marine life and pollute our water supply. Even worse, many of these bottles never make it to a recycling plant and instead end up in landfills, where they can take hundreds of years to decompose.\n\nBut plastic bottles can also have serious consequences for human health. Research has shown that chemicals from plastic bottles can leach into the water, and these chemicals have been linked to a variety of health problems, including cancer and reproductive disorders.\n\nSo the next time you\u2019re thinking about grabbing a plastic bottle, consider making the switch to a reusable bottle. Not only will you be doing your part to protect the environment, but you\u2019ll also be helping to keep yourself healthy.\n",

    "output_2":"Here are a few key benefits JAX offers over PyTorch:\n\n1. **Performance** - JAX compiles expressions into high-performance code using the XLA compiler. This is often able to beat hand-tuned PyTorch code. See for example [this](https:\/\/github.com\/google\/jax\/tree\/master\/examples\/mlp_vs_torch) example comparing a simple MLP in JAX vs PyTorch.\n2. **Composable Differentiable Programming** - The core of JAX is built around ```jit```, which compiles any ```def``` function (e.g. a neural network) into an autograd function. This means that users can define a neural network, or a training loop, as a function that is jitted at runtime, without any need for manual code. JAX also supports a variety of higher-level tools like ```vmap```, ```partial``` and ```jit``` which make building models, training loops and differentiable algorithms even easier.\n3. **Composable Numeric Programming** - The ```jax``` library provides a set of ```numpy```-like operations (e.g. ```grad```, ```vmap```, ```jacobian```, etc) that allow users to define algorithms involving differentiation, and apply them to arbitrary ```numpy```-like arrays.\n4. **Easier to debug** - ```jax``` compiles your code to XLA. This means that you can debug errors by just looking at the XLA code that JAX generated, and not your potentially messy neural network code.\n5. **Composability** - The ```jax``` and ```jaxlib``` libraries (as well as [Haiku](https:\/\/github.com\/deepmind\/dm-haiku)) contain a number of useful tools (e.g. optimizers, losses, activation functions, etc) that can be composed with each other.\n6. **Maturity** - The core ```jax``` library is stable, and has been used in production at DeepMind for many years.  The ```jaxlib``` library is still under active development, but is mostly stable.\n7. **Scalability** - XLA runs on a variety of devices (GPU, TPU, CPU), and ```jax``` can easily distribute your computations over multiple devices. See for example [this](https:\/\/github.com\/google\/jax\/tree\/master\/examples\/linear_interpolation) example using ```vmap``` to compute the gradients of a matrix factorization in parallel across multiple TPUs.\n\nThere are also some limitations of JAX vs PyTorch:\n\n1. ```jaxlib``` is still under active development, and contains a smaller number of operations than PyTorch.\n2. JAX does not support ```CUDA``` or ```MKLDNN``` (which would require ```CUDA``` or ```MKLDNN``` support in XLA).\n\n\n",

These measures can help to boost demand, create jobs, and stimulate growth.\n\nMonetary policy measures involve changing the supply of money and credit in the economy, in order to influence inflation and interest rates. During a recession, central banks can lower interest rates and increase the supply of money in order to stimulate growth. This makes it cheaper for businesses to borrow money and invest, and for consumers to borrow money to buy goods and services.\n\nIn addition to these macroeconomic policies, governments can also introduce microeconomic reforms to improve the competitiveness of the economy, such as reducing red tape and regulations, reforming the tax system, and improving the education and training of the workforce.

    "output_1":"First, it's important to note that the current study used a small number of patients (10) who had already tested positive for the virus by PCR. So it's not a \"better than a dog\" study, but a \"competitive with a dog\" study. And in this study, the dog was trained for two weeks with patients who already tested positive for COVID.\n\nAlso, in the study, the dog was able to smell the virus in exhaled breath samples, not directly in patients. So it's not like they can just let the dog sniff people. They have to do some preparation, like exhale into a plastic bag, and then the dog smells that.\n\nSo what's stopping us from building a machine? Well, dogs' noses are pretty impressive. The olfactory bulb in the dog's brain is about 40 times larger than the human olfactory bulb. And dogs have about 300 million olfactory receptor genes, while we have about 400. This gives dogs an olfactory system that's about 10,000 times more sensitive than humans.\n\nSo it seems unlikely that we'll be able to replicate the dog's olfactory ability any time soon. However, there are other ways to detect the virus, such as looking for the presence of the virus's genetic material in the body. These tests are not as sensitive as the dog's nose, but they're also faster, easier, and cheaper.\n\nSo while a dog's nose may be able to detect COVID better than a machine can, it's still not a perfect tool. In the end, we'll need a combination of testing methods to get the best results.\n",

(Not to mention the privacy and ethical concerns involved.)\nSecond, dogs can detect COVID when the virus load is still low. A PCR test can detect the virus only after the virus load has built up.\nThird, and most importantly, dogs can smell COVID in patients that don't have symptoms. This is key. When a dog smells COVID on a person, it can alert us that the person has COVID. We don't have to wait for the person to develop symptoms to know they have COVID. And that's a huge advantage. A PCR test only tells us if a person has COVID, it doesn't tell us if a person has COVID but is asymptomatic.\n",

This can make it difficult to share ideas and information, and can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication. Cultural barriers can also affect communication, by creating different expectations about what is acceptable to say and how to say it. For example, in some cultures it is considered impolite to ask personal questions, while in others it is expected that people will share personal information. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication when people from different cultures try to communicate.\n\nLanguage and cultural barriers can also affect the formation of relationships in multicultural societies. People from different cultures may have different expectations about what is appropriate in relationships, such as how to show affection, how to express intimacy, and how to resolve conflicts. These differences can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication, which can make it difficult to form and maintain relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, language and cultural barriers can limit what can be communicated and understood, and can create different expectations about how to behave, which can affect communication and the formation of relationships in multicultural societies.\n",

In multicultural societies, people from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds often have to communicate with one another in order to work together, learn from one another, and form friendships.  However, language and cultural differences can make communication challenging, and can create misunderstandings and barriers to forming relationships.\n\n## Communication Challenges\n\n### Misunderstandings\n\nPeople from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds often use different words, phrases, and expressions to communicate ideas and emotions.  This can lead to misunderstandings, such as when one person thinks they are being insulted, when the other person was actually using a phrase that is neutral or even positive in their culture.  For example, in some cultures it is common to use expressions that sound like insults as a way of expressing affection or teasing, such as \"stupid donkey\" in Arabic or \"idiot\" in Spanish.  However, if someone from a culture where these phrases are neutral or positive uses them with someone from a culture where they are offensive, it can lead to misunderstandings and offense.\n\n### Lack of Common Ground\n\nPeople from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds often have different experiences, knowledge, and backgrounds, which can make it difficult to find common ground when communicating.  For example, someone from a rural farming community in a non-English-speaking country may not have the same knowledge of popular culture as someone from a large city in an English-speaking country.  This can make it difficult for them to find topics of conversation or things they have in common.\n\n### Different Communication Styles\n\nPeople from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds often have different communication styles, such as how they express emotions, assert themselves, and negotiate agreements.  This can make it challenging to communicate effectively, as people may misinterpret each other\u2019s communication styles and words.  For example, someone from a culture where people are more reserved and indirect in their communication may be misunderstood as passive-aggressive by someone from a culture where people are more direct and assertive in their communication.\n\n## Overcoming Barriers\n\n### Learning About Each Other\u2019s Cultures\n\nOne way people from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds can overcome barriers to communication and form relationships is by learning about each other\u2019s cultures.  This can help people gain a deeper understanding of each other and appreciate differences.  It can also help people find common ground and make communication easier.  For example, if someone from a culture where people are more reserved and indirect in their communication learns that someone from a culture where people are more direct and assertive in their communication has a similar communication style, it can help them better understand each other.\n\n### Communicating Openly and Honestly\n\nAnother way people from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds can overcome communication barriers and form relationships is by communicating openly and honestly with one another.  This can help reduce misunderstandings and make communication easier.  For example, if someone from a culture where people are more reserved and indirect in their communication is confused by someone from a culture where people are more direct and assertive in their communication, they can ask for clarification or explanation.  This can help reduce misunderstandings and avoid unnecessary conflict.\n",

    "output_1":"Vaccines are a type of biological preparation that stimulates an individual's immune system to produce antibodies, without causing the full-blown infection. Vaccinations are very effective at preventing infectious diseases, and have eliminated or eradicated many diseases worldwide.\n\nThere are two main types of vaccines:\n* *Live vaccines* contain a weakened or attenuated form of the virus or bacterium, which enables the immune system to recognize and fight the disease-causing pathogen without causing serious illness.\n* *Inactivated vaccines* contain antigens that have been extracted from the virus or bacterium.\n\nVaccinations can protect both individuals and communities by preventing infections, reducing the severity of illnesses, and lowering the risk of spreading diseases to others. Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies, which can protect individuals from becoming infected with a disease-causing pathogen or from developing severe illnesses. Herd immunity is when a large proportion of a population is immune to a disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, thereby protecting individuals who are unable to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccines are one of the most effective public health interventions for preventing infectious diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that vaccines have saved more than 50 million lives since the 1990s.\n\nSome common infectious diseases that are prevented by vaccines include:\n* *Measles* is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that can lead to complications such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and pneumonia. Measles can be fatal in young children. It is one of the most contagious diseases known, with an unvaccinated individual able to spread it to 18 other people. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000.\n* *Rubella* is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that can cause serious birth defects if a pregnant woman is infected. Rubella was declared eliminated in the United States in 2004.\n* *Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)* is a bacteria that can cause serious infections in young children, such as meningitis (inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord), pneumonia, and blood infections. Hib was declared eliminated in the United States in 2019.\n* *Poliomyelitis* is a viral disease that can cause paralysis or death. Polio was declared eliminated in the United States in 2019.\n* *Varicella* is a virus that can cause chickenpox, a very itchy rash, and fever. While most people recover from chickenpox, some can develop serious complications such as pneumonia or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).

    "output_2":"Vaccinations work by giving the body a weakened form of a disease, which allows the body to build immunity without suffering the full effects of the disease.  This is different from immunity gained by surviving an infection, which is often referred to as natural immunity.\n\nVaccinations are widely considered to be one of the most important public health interventions ever developed, saving millions of lives and helping to eradicate diseases like smallpox.  In recent years, however, there has been a rise in distrust of vaccinations, often fueled by false or misleading information.  This has led to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, which can be dangerous or deadly, especially for young children.\n\nHerd immunity is the protection that a population receives from infectious diseases when a large percentage of individuals are immune, whether through vaccination or natural immunity.  This protects those who are unable to be vaccinated, such as infants, and those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.  Herd immunity can be difficult to achieve, however, since it relies on a high vaccination rate in a community.  Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases can occur when vaccination rates drop below this threshold.\n",

    "instruction":"How do social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news, and what are the potential implications for the spread of misinformation?\n",
    "output_1":"Social media has become a dominant force in the news industry. While traditional media companies have struggled to keep up with the pace of change, social media platforms have found new ways to deliver news to audiences. One of the most significant changes has been the rise of user-generated content. People no longer have to rely on traditional news outlets to get their information; they can turn to their friends and family for news and opinions.\n\nThis shift in power has created both opportunities and challenges for news organizations. On the one hand, it has allowed them to reach new audiences and engage with their readers in new ways. On the other hand, it has made it harder to control the flow of information and to verify the accuracy of news stories.\n\nAnother important change has been the way that news spreads on social media. Traditional media companies used to control the distribution of their content through newspapers and television broadcasts. Now, news stories can spread virally on social media platforms, reaching millions of people within hours.\n\nThis has created both opportunities and challenges for news organizations. On the one hand, it allows them to reach new audiences and spread their messages more effectively. On the other hand, it can make it harder to control the flow of information and to verify the accuracy of news stories.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for news organizations is the spread of misinformation on social media. Fake news stories can spread quickly and reach a large audience before they are debunked. This has become a significant problem in recent years, with fake news stories playing a role in the 2016 US presidential election and other events.\n\nNews organizations have tried to combat the spread of misinformation by publishing fact-checks and corrections, but this has often been ineffective.

    "instruction":"Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species.\n",
    "output_1":"Natural selection is a fundamental process of evolution. It explains why populations change over time and how species adapt to their environments. Here is an explanation of natural selection and how it contributes to evolution and adaptation:\n\n* Variation: Natural selection starts with variation. This is the presence of differences within a population. These differences can be genetic or non-genetic. For example, some individuals in a population may have a genetic mutation that allows them to survive in a new environment, while others do not have the mutation and die. Or, individuals may differ in behavior or appearance.\n\n* Differential Survival and Reproduction: The environment exerts a selective pressure on the population, causing some individuals to survive and reproduce better than others. This means that individuals with certain traits are more likely to pass those traits on to their offspring.\n\n* Adaptation: Over time, the population changes as a result of natural selection. Individuals with beneficial traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, while those with detrimental traits are less likely to survive and reproduce. This leads to an increase in the frequency of beneficial traits in the population and a decrease in the frequency of detrimental traits.\n\n* Evolution: Over multiple generations, natural selection can lead to major changes in a population. For example, a population of animals may adapt to a new food source by evolving longer digestive systems. Or, a population of plants may evolve to resist a new pathogen by developing stronger defenses.\n\n* Evolution of New Species: Over very long periods of time, natural selection can lead to the formation of new species. For example, two populations that are isolated from each other may evolve different traits as they adapt to different environments. Over time, these differences may become so great that the populations can no longer reproduce with each other. This is called speciation.\n\nIn summary, natural selection is a process that drives evolution and adaptation. It occurs when individuals in a population differ in their ability to survive and reproduce, and those with beneficial traits are more likely to pass them on to their offspring. Over time, this can lead to major changes in the population, including the evolution of new species.\n",

    "datasplit":"test",
    "output_2":"The process of natural selection, as described by Charles Darwin, is the mechanism by which species evolve and adapt over time. The process works by selecting for traits that help an organism survive in its environment.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nLet's say there is a population of finches on an island. Some of these finches have beaks that are better adapted to eating seeds, while others have beaks better adapted to eating insects. If there is a drought on the island, the finches with the seed-eating beaks will have a harder time finding food. Those finches with insect-eating beaks, however, will have an easier time finding food. Therefore, those finches with insect-eating beaks will have more offspring, passing on their insect-eating beaks to the next generation. Over time, the population of finches will evolve to have more insect-eating beaks, because those beaks are better adapted to the new environment.\n\nIn summary, natural selection acts to select for traits that help an organism survive and reproduce in its environment. Over time, these adaptations can lead to significant evolutionary change.\n",

I roam the wastelands, searching for survivors and supplies, and helping anyone who needs it. I've helped rescue people from zombie hordes, I've helped supply bases with food and medicine, and I've even helped train people in combat. I've made many friends along the way, and I've had to fight off countless enemies.

He's helped me fight off zombies, he's kept me company when I was lonely, and he's always been there to lick my wounds when I was hurt. I couldn't imagine surviving without him.\n\nAnother ally I've found is a group of survivors known as the Sanctuary. They are a group of people who have banded together to form a safe haven for others. They have fortified their base and train people to fight off the zombies. I've helped them with supplies and protection, and they've helped me with information and supplies.\n\nAnother ally I've found is a group of scientists known as the Lab. They are trying to find a cure for the virus, and they've given me information on the zombies and how to fight them.

    "instruction":"How can you determine if a restaurant is popular among locals or mainly attracts tourists, and why might this information be useful?\n",
    "output_1":"This is a good question, and the answer may not be as simple as it seems. There are a number of factors that can influence a restaurant's popularity, including:\n\n* Word-of-mouth: A restaurant that is popular among locals is more likely to be recommended by friends and family, who are often more discerning diners than tourists.\n* Atmosphere: Locals are more likely to prefer a relaxed, casual atmosphere, while tourists may be more interested in a more formal or upscale dining experience.\n* Menu: Locals are more likely to prefer a more varied menu that reflects the region's cuisine, while tourists may be more interested in a limited menu of international dishes.\n* Prices: Locals are more likely to prefer affordable, mid-range prices, while tourists may be more interested in expensive, upscale restaurants.\n* Service: Locals are more likely to prefer friendly, informal service, while tourists may be more interested in formal, attentive service.\n\nIn addition to these factors, it is important to consider the location of the restaurant. Locals are more likely to frequent restaurants that are conveniently located near their homes or workplaces, while tourists are more likely to visit restaurants that are located near popular tourist attractions.\n\nWhy might this information be useful? Understanding whether a restaurant attracts locals or tourists can help diners decide whether the restaurant is likely to meet their expectations. For example, if a diner is looking for a relaxed, casual dining experience, they may prefer a restaurant that attracts locals. On the other hand, if a diner is looking for a more formal or upscale dining experience, they may prefer a restaurant that attracts tourists.\n",

If there are none, or only a few, then the restaurant is probably popular with tourists.\n*  Check the menu.  If it is in multiple languages, then it is probably popular with tourists.\n*  Notice the prices.  If they are high, then it is probably popular with tourists.\n*  Look at the clientele.  If they are all dressed up, then it is probably popular with tourists.\n*  Check the decor.  If it is fancy, then it is probably popular with tourists.\n*  Ask your hotel concierge.  They will know which restaurants are popular with locals.\n*  Check the TripAdvisor reviews.  If the restaurant has mostly positive reviews, then it is probably popular with locals.\n\nSo, why might this information be useful?  If you want to eat where the locals eat, then you should choose a restaurant that is popular with locals.  You will likely have better food and an authentic experience.\n",

While it is important to consider the reputation of the author and publisher, other factors should also be considered.\n\nWhen evaluating the credibility of a source of information, consider the following:\n\n* Purpose: Is the source trying to persuade, inform, or entertain?\n* Bias: Is the source biased in favor of or against a particular point of view?\n* Methods: How was the information gathered and presented?\n* Evidence: Does the source provide evidence to support its claims?\n* Accuracy: Is the information accurate and up-to-date?\n* Authority: Who is the source of the information and what are their credentials?\n* Currency: When was the information created or last updated?\n* Sponsorship: Who is funding the creation and dissemination of the information?\n\nBy considering these factors, you can make an informed decision about the credibility of a source of information.\n",

    "output_2":"The easiest way to check the credibility of a source is to check the sources it uses.  If a blog post or news article cites reliable sources (especially ones that have a reputation for fact-checking and verifying their information), then you can trust the information in the post.  However, even if the sources are reliable, you should still check the information in those sources to make sure that it\u2019s being accurately presented and interpreted.\n\nIt\u2019s also helpful to look for clues in the blog post or news article itself.  For example, if the post uses inflammatory language or makes unsupported claims, it\u2019s probably not very credible.  Similarly, if the post is full of typos and grammatical errors, it\u2019s probably not a reliable source.\n\nFinally, you can try to assess the credibility of a source by looking at the author\u2019s or publisher\u2019s track record.  If they\u2019ve consistently published accurate and reliable information in the past, then you can assume that they\u2019re probably doing the same with the article you\u2019re reading.  However, keep in mind that even the most reputable sources can make mistakes, so it\u2019s always a good idea to double-check their information.\n",

    "output_1":"There are two broad categories of explanations for why some people like being scared while others don't: psychological and evolutionary.\n\nPsychological explanations\n\n* [Fight-or-flight](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fight-or-flight_response): An evolutionary mechanism designed to enable us to either fight off an aggressor or flee from them. Being scared triggers the same response in our bodies. This mechanism is a necessary component of survival, so over time it has been wired into us to experience pleasure when we are scared. \n* [Arousal](https:\/\/www.apa.org\/monitor\/2006\/10\/fear-fun.aspx): This is the psychological term for being scared. Some people have a higher \"threshold\" for arousal than others, meaning that they need to be scared a lot before they enjoy it, while others can enjoy being scared more easily. This is not necessarily a sign of bravery, but simply of being able to enjoy being scared more easily. \n* [Socialization](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socialization): The idea that our enjoyment of certain experiences is shaped by social factors, such as what other people expect of us. For example, some cultures value bravery more than others, and as a result people in those cultures are more likely to enjoy being scared. \n* [Social bonding](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/the-social-animal\/201104\/why-people-like-being-scared): A theory that some people enjoy being scared because it helps them form bonds with others. This is especially true of scary movies, which are often watched in groups. The thrill of being scared together helps to create a sense of intimacy and closeness between people.\n\nEvolutionary explanations\n\n* [Adaptation](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/308513): The idea that our enjoyment of being scared is a result of natural selection. Animals that were easily scared were less likely to survive, so over time the genes for enjoying being scared became more common. \n* [Evoked affinity](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/quotes\/170511-there-is-a-feeling-that-many-of-us-have-experienced-at): The idea that our enjoyment of being scared is a result of our innate desire to bond with others. When we feel scared, our body releases chemicals that make us feel close to the people we are scared with. \n* [Evolutionary purpose](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/quotes\/170511-there-is-a-feeling-that-many-of-us-have-experienced-at): The idea that our enjoyment of being scared is a result of natural selection. Animals that were easily scared were less likely to survive, so over time the genes for enjoying being scared became more common.\n",

    "output_2":"Many people enjoy activities that scare them because it can be exhilarating, it can be a rush, or because it provides a sense of accomplishment. For some, experiencing fear is part of the fun. For example, many people enjoy scary movies and horror books because they find the thrill of being scared enjoyable. Similarly, some people enjoy thrill rides like roller coasters because they find the fear and adrenaline rush enjoyable. Some people also enjoy scary video games or other activities that involve risk-taking or danger, such as bungee jumping or skydiving.\n\nFor some people, the thrill of being scared is so enjoyable that they seek out activities specifically designed to scare them. These people are often called thrill-seekers, and they often participate in extreme sports or other dangerous activities in order to get a rush of adrenaline. For example, some thrill-seekers enjoy going bungee jumping or skydiving, activities that involve a significant risk of injury or death. Similarly, some thrill-seekers enjoy participating in extreme sports such as snowboarding or mountain climbing, which often involve hazardous conditions and a high risk of injury.\n",

In order to work, it needed to count the threads on the warp (the horizontal frame), which was done with a complex set of cogs.\nThis inspired the Banu Musa brothers, who designed and built the first gear-driven clocks in the Islamic Golden Age. The earliest clocks were used to tell the Muslim prayer times, but soon the technology spread to Europe, where it was refined.\nIn the 13th century, Roger Bacon proposed that a device could be built to measure time, and also transmit mechanical power over long distances. It took another four centuries for anyone to take him seriously, but in the 1500s, Leonardo da Vinci designed a clockwork device that could store energy and transmit it over a distance, using rotating wheels.\nLeonardo's designs were lost after his death, but in the 17th century, Galileo Galilei managed to recreate them. He took Leonardo's design and modified it into an early type of generator, which could be powered by water, wind, or muscle power. He also created a series of lenses that could concentrate light into a beam, which he dubbed the \"catoptric telegraph\".\nBy the 18th century, the British Empire had spread across the world, and was in need of a faster way to communicate across long distances. After decades of work, James Watt managed to improve the steam engine, which allowed the first primitive \"steam trains\" to be built. In 1844, Samuel Morse devised the first electrical telegraph, and within ten years, a transatlantic cable had been laid.\nIn the 1850s, the internet was invented, allowing information to be sent across the world in seconds. The internet's creators also invented the first search engine, which used optical character recognition to read text from images. By the 1970s, the internet had become a global network, with millions of websites and billions of users.\nIf not for the inventions made in the Islamic Golden Age, the internet may never have been invented. The Islamic world was the leading scientific and technological power in the world for centuries, and many of the inventions that led to the modern world were made by Muslim scientists. If the Banu Musa brothers hadn't invented the gear-driven clock, it's unlikely that anyone else would have, and the modern world might still be waiting for a way to measure time.\n",

Here are some possibilities of what may have happened if Newton had pursued a career in biology instead:\n\n* Newton may have discovered the binomial nomenclature system, which is used to classify and name organisms.  This system, developed by Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus in the 18th century, uses two parts to name each organism: the genus (plural: genera) and the species.  The genus is usually capitalized and is a category of related organisms, while the species is the specific type of organism.

The first column will store the Fibonacci numbers and the second column will store the sum of the 2 previous numbers.\n\nFor example, if we want to find the 10th Fibonacci number, we can start by filling the first row with the first 2 Fibonacci numbers: 0 and 1. Then, we fill the second row with the values of the first column plus the value of the second column: 1 and 1+0=1. Next, we fill the third row with the values of the second column plus the value of the third column: 1+1=2 and 2+1=3. And so on until we fill the last row with the values of the 9th column plus the value of the 10th column: 55+67=122.\n\nThe 10th Fibonacci number is stored in the 10th row and 1st column, which is the number of times we've added the previous 2 numbers together.\n\nHere is the implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using Dynamic Programming:\n\n```\ndef fib(n):\n  if n == 0 or n == 1:\n    return n\n  arr = [[0, 1], [1, 1]]\n  for i in range(2, n+1):\n    arr.append([arr[i-1][0]+arr[i-1][1], arr[i-1][1]])\n  return arr[n][0]\n```\n\nHere is the time complexity of the above algorithm:\n\n* Space Complexity: O(n) because we are using a 2-dimensional array of size n+1 x 2.\n* Time Complexity: O(n) because we are iterating over the array n times.\n",

    "output_1":"If you do:\n```new_list = my_list```\n\nYou're just creating a new reference to the same object as ```my_list```.  In Python, everything is an object, even numbers and strings.  \nSo if you do this:\n```my_list[2] = 'foo'\n```\n\nThat will change ```my_list``` to have the value ```['a', 'b', 'foo']```, because you're changing the same object that ```new_list``` is pointing to.\nTo create a copy of the list, use ```my_list[:]```.  This creates a new object, a copy of the list object, and assigns it to the variable ```my_list```.  To see this, you can run this:\n```print id(my_list)\nprint id(my_list[:])\n```\n\nYou'll see that the second print line returns a new integer, which means that a new object was created.\n\nThis will create a shallow copy of the list.  If your list has objects that are themselves mutable, like lists, dictionaries, or sets, those will still point to the same object that was in the original list.  For example:\n```a = ['foo', ['bar', [1, 2, 3]]]\nb = a[:]\nb[1][1].append(4)\nprint a\n```\n\nThis will print:\n```['foo', ['bar', [1, 2, 3, 4]]]\n```\n\nThis is because the last line changed the second element of ```b```, which still pointed to the same object in memory as ```a[1]```.  If you want to create a deep copy, you need to copy the nested lists and dictionaries separately.  In this case, that would look like this:\n```a = ['foo', ['bar', [1, 2, 3]]]\nb = ['foo', ['bar', [1, 2, 3]]]\nb[1] = a[1][:]\n```\n\nThat will give you a deep copy of the list, and if you try the same thing you tried before, this time it will not change ```a```.\n\nIf you're dealing with big lists, it can be a pain to copy it in this way.  There's a nice little function in the ```copy``` module called ```deepcopy``` that will do it for you.\nSo if you have a big list of things and you want to make sure you have a copy of it that you can modify without changing the original, you can do this:\n```import copy\nb = copy.deepcopy(a)\nb[1] = a[1][:]\n```\n\nand now ```b``` is a completely separate copy of the list.\n",

    "instruction":"Write a script for a YouTube video exploring the history and cultural significance of jazz.\n",
    "output_1":"Jazz is one of the most important musical genres in American history. It has its roots in African-American communities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was born out of the interaction between African musical traditions and European styles. As it evolved, jazz incorporated elements from other genres such as blues, ragtime, and swing. Today, jazz is enjoyed by people all over the world.\n\nThe history of jazz is long and complex. In the late 19th century, African-American musicians began to play jazz-like music in New Orleans. This music was influenced by both African and European traditions. It incorporated elements such as call-and-response patterns and polyrhythms. As the genre developed, it spread throughout the United States. By the early 20th century, jazz had become a popular form of entertainment.\n\nIn the 1920s, jazz began to take on a more complex sound. Musicians started experimenting with new rhythms and instruments. They also began to improvise more freely. This era is often referred to as the \"golden age\" of jazz.\n\nIn the 1930s, big bands became popular. These bands featured large ensembles of musicians. They played sophisticated arrangements of jazz tunes. Many of the most famous jazz musicians of the time performed in big bands.\n\nAfter World War II, jazz began to diversify. Musicians from around the world began to play the genre. They brought their own influences to the music. As a result, jazz became more international in scope.\n\nIn the 1950s, bebop emerged as a new style of jazz. It was fast and complex. It also featured extended solos. Miles Davis and John Coltrane are two of the most famous bebop musicians.\n\nIn the 1960s, jazz became more experimental. Artists such as John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman pushed the boundaries of the genre. They explored new ways of playing and composing music.\n\nIn the 1970s, jazz became more mainstream. Artists such as Dave Brubeck and Herbie Hancock enjoyed widespread success.\n\nIn the 1980s, jazz became more popular outside of the United States. Artists such as Weather Report and Miles Davis helped to introduce the genre to new audiences.\n\nIn the 1990s, jazz continued to diversify. Artists such as Wynton Marsalis and Pat Metheny explored new styles.\n\nIn the 2000s, jazz continued to evolve. Artists such as Esperanza Spalding and Trombone Shorty helped to bring the genre into the 21st century.\n\nToday, jazz remains a vital part of American culture. It is enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds. It continues to inspire new generations of musicians.\n",

    "instruction":"Structure a podcast script for an episode discussing the influence of streaming platforms on the music industry.\n",
    "output_1":"Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Music Business Podcast. I'm your host, John Smith. Today, we are talking about the impact of streaming platforms on the music industry.\n\nTo kick things off, let's take a look at how the music industry used to work. Musicians would record albums and release them on CDs or vinyl records. Fans would buy the albums and listen to them at home or in their cars. The artists would then go on tour to promote the album and make money from ticket sales and merchandise.\n\nThe music industry has changed a lot since then. One of the biggest changes is the rise of streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. Instead of buying albums, fans can now listen to music for free or pay a monthly fee to access an unlimited catalogue of songs. This has had a huge impact on the way artists make money. Instead of selling albums, they rely on streams and touring to make money.\n\nAnother major change is the way music is discovered. In the past, fans would have to watch music videos on television or buy magazines to find out about new artists. Now, they can listen to playlists curated by streaming platforms and follow their favourite musicians on social media. This has led to a more diverse range of music being heard by listeners, as they are exposed to new genres and artists that they might not have otherwise discovered.\n\nTo conclude, the music industry has been transformed by streaming platforms in the past decade. Artists now rely on streaming revenue and touring to make money, and fans can discover new music more easily than ever before.\n",

    "output_2":"Welcome to Music Business, the podcast that examines the intersection of music and business. I'm your host, Austin Smith, and today we're talking about the influence of streaming platforms on the music industry.\nSo far in 2020, music streaming has generated $11.6 billion in revenue. That's up 15% from the previous year, and streaming accounts for over 70% of the music industry's revenue. These numbers aren't surprising when you consider that people streamed music over 40 billion times per day in 2019. The most popular streaming platforms right now are YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, which account for over 80% of music streaming revenue.\nWhen streaming first became popular, artists were concerned that they weren't being paid enough, and that streaming platforms were devaluing their music by allowing users to access songs for free. Artists like Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj pulled their music from Spotify to protest the low royalties paid to artists. In 2014, Swift famously wrote a New York Times op-ed about how streaming undervalued music. But as streaming platforms grew in popularity, many artists began to see the value in making their music available to as many people as possible, even if it meant giving it away for free.\nSo why did artists start to embrace streaming? Well, the biggest reason is that it allows artists to connect directly with fans. In the past, artists depended on record labels to promote their music and help them grow their fan base. But with streaming, artists can reach fans directly, without the help of a label. Streaming also allows artists to make money from touring and merchandise, which are now their biggest sources of income.\nBut streaming has also created new challenges for artists. For example, some artists complain that they don't make enough money from streaming to justify the time and effort it takes to record and release music. Others worry that streaming encourages people to value music less, since it's so easy to access. And some artists have had their music stolen and uploaded to streaming platforms without their permission.\nSo while streaming has definitely changed the music industry, it's also created new opportunities for artists. As streaming platforms continue to grow in popularity, it will be interesting to see how the music industry adapts.\n",

This implied recognition of the Russian SFSR as the successor state of the RSFSR, and not the Ukrainian SSR, of the USSR. As a result, the Russian SFSR was admitted as a UN member on 24 Octoberlam, while the Ukrainian SSR was admitted on 30 Novemberlam.\n\nThe Crimean Oblast, with its capital Simferopol, was a constituent part of the Ukrainian SSR. At the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it had a Russian majority (56%), but with a significant Ukrainian minority (33%).\n\nIn March 2014, Crimea held a referendum on whether to leave Ukraine and join Russia. This referendum was widely condemned as illegal by the international community, and the UN General Assembly voted in favor of a non-binding resolution that condemned the referendum as illegal. On 16 March 2014, Crimea declared independence from Ukraine and asked to join the Russian Federation. The Russian Federation responded by annexing Crimea on 18 March 2014, and the UN General Assembly subsequently voted in favor of a second resolution, condemning the annexation as illegal.\n\nSince the annexation, the international community has widely considered Crimea to be part of Ukraine. However, the Russian Federation considers Crimea to be an integral part of Russia.\n",

    "output_1":"Monopoly is a game of strategy. It is impossible to provide one \"best\" strategy, since there are many ways to play the game. Here are some strategies that can be used to win the game:\n\n* Land on Chance or Community Chest cards that give you money, and avoid landing on cards that cost you money.\n* Build houses on your properties as soon as possible. This protects your property from other players landing on it and developing it.\n* Try to acquire properties that are next to each other, so that you can build houses on all of them. This will protect those properties and increase your rent income.\n* Develop your properties, by building houses and hotels on them. This increases the rent that you collect from other players when they land on them.\n* Trade properties with other players. This can be a good strategy if you have a lot of properties that are not connected, or if you are short on one color.\n* Avoid going to Jail, since it costs you money and time.\n* Try to develop the properties on Baltic Avenue, since they are worth more money than the others.\n* Try to buy properties that are located near the beginning of the railroads. This will give you a head start on developing those properties.\n* Make deals with other players. For example, you can agree to trade properties, or to not develop certain properties. This can help you win the game, but it can also backfire if the other player doesn't hold up their end of the deal.\n* Try to win the game by buying all of the properties. This can be difficult, but if you can do it, you will win the game.\n\nThese are just a few of the strategies that can be used to win the game of Monopoly.

    "output_2":"Monopoly is a game with many nuances, and there are several strategies that you can use to win the game.\n\n## Basic strategies\n\n### 1. Buy all the properties on your color group\n\nIf you're just learning the game, this is a good strategy for quickly building a property portfolio.  You can use this strategy to accumulate wealth quickly and buy other properties.  However, it is also a risky strategy as you will be paying full price for all your properties.  If you are unable to collect rent from other players, this strategy can be costly.\n\n### 2. Avoid buying properties early in the game\n\nIf you are an experienced player, you might want to avoid buying properties early in the game.  This strategy will help you accumulate money to buy properties later in the game.  It will also allow you to buy properties at a discount.  However, this strategy can be risky if you are unable to build a property portfolio.  You will also be unable to collect rent from other players.\n\n### 3. Trade properties with other players\n\nTrading properties with other players is another good strategy for building a property portfolio.  You can trade properties with other players to get a discount on your purchases.  However, this strategy is risky as you will be relying on other players to trade with you.  You will also be unable to collect rent from other players.\n\n### 4. Buy all the utilities\n\nIf you have a lot of money, you can buy all the utilities in the game.  This strategy will allow you to collect rent from other players.  However, it is a risky strategy as you will be relying on other players to pay rent to you.  You will also be unable to collect rent from other players.\n\n### 5. Buy houses and hotels\n\nIf you have a lot of money, you can buy houses and hotels on your properties.  This strategy will allow you to collect rent from other players.  However, it is a risky strategy as you will be relying on other players to pay rent to you.  You will also be unable to collect rent from other players.\n\n## Advanced strategies\n\n### 6. Borrow money from the bank\n\nIf you are an experienced player, you can borrow money from the bank to buy properties.  This strategy will allow you to accumulate wealth quickly.  However, it is a risky strategy as you will be relying on the bank to lend you money.  You will also be unable to collect rent from other players.\n\n### 7. Buy houses and hotels early in the game\n\nIf you are an experienced player, you can buy houses and hotels early in the game.  This strategy will allow you to accumulate wealth quickly.

    "instruction":"When will we make first contact with an alien intelligence? Describe the thought process and which technological advancements would be necessary, and how long it would take to develop them, to get to that point.\n",
    "output_1":"Estimating when humans will make contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) is a difficult exercise, as it requires both knowledge of the current state of technology and the ability to make educated guesses about future technological development. There are several different possible avenues by which humans might make contact with an ETI, but perhaps the most likely and well-studied pathway is radio communication.\n\nOne of the earliest attempts to estimate when humans might make radio contact with an ETI was a 1959 paper by Giuseppe Cocconi and Philip Morrison, who proposed that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) should focus on nearby stars within 20 light years of the solar system. They estimated that there might be 1 to 100 intelligent civilizations within this radius, and that it might take 10,000 to 100,000 years for such a civilization to develop radio technology.\n\nIn 1974, Frank Drake formulated the Drake equation, a probabilistic method for estimating the number of technological civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The equation takes into account several factors, including the rate at which stars form, the fraction of those stars that have planets, the number of planets that can support life, the fraction of those planets on which life actually develops, the fraction of planets on which life develops intelligent life, the fraction of those planets on which intelligent life develops technology, and the length of time for which a technological civilization transmits signals into space. Using this equation, Drake estimated that there might be as many as 10,000 technological civilizations in the Milky Way.\n\nIn 1984, astronomer Peter Davidsen proposed that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence should focus on the closest stars, within 10 light years of the solar system. He estimated that there might be 1 to 100 technological civilizations within this radius, and that it might take 10,000 to 100,000 years for such a civilization to develop radio technology.\n\nIn 1992, Seth Shostak estimated that humans might make radio contact with an extraterrestrial civilization within the next 50 to 100 years. He noted that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) was a young field, and that technological development was accelerating, so it was possible that humans would make contact with an ETI much sooner than expected.\n\nIn 2001, SETI astronomer Douglas Vakoch estimated that humans might make radio contact with an extraterrestrial civilization within the next 50 to 100 years. He noted that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) was a young field, and that technological development was accelerating, so it was possible that humans would make contact with an ETI much sooner than expected.\n\nIn 2010, Frank Drake estimated that humans might make radio contact with an extraterrestrial civilization within the next 50 to 100 years. He noted that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) was a young field, and that technological development was accelerating, so it was possible that humans would make contact with an ETI much sooner than expected.\n\nIn 2014, SETI astronomer Seth Shostak estimated that humans might make radio contact with an extraterrestrial civilization within the next 50 to 100 years. He noted that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) was a young field, and that technological development was accelerating, so it was possible that humans would make contact with an ETI much sooner than expected.\n\nIn summary, estimates of when humans might make radio contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) range from 50 to 100 years to 10,000 to 100,000 years. There is considerable uncertainty in these estimates, as they rely on probabilistic assumptions about the prevalence of life and intelligence in the universe. It is likely that humans will make radio contact with an ETI in the next century, but it is also possible that it could take much longer.\n",

We've got no idea how different alien lifeforms might be, and until we could determine a shared language or code between us, communication would be impossible. And even once we'd developed a way of communicating with aliens, we'd need to decide whether to make contact with them.\n\nIf we decide it's worth making contact, we'll need to send a message out into space that will travel at the speed of light, to the planets that might have life on them, so we could be waiting a very long time for a response.\n\nIf we received a response, then it would be a very long time before we could send a spacecraft there and back. Even if we had warp drive and could travel at warp speed, it could still take hundreds of years to reach the closest star that has planets. So that's assuming we had warp drive. It's very unlikely we'd have warp drive, or any form of FTL travel for many many centuries, if ever.\n\nSo, assuming we've mastered FTL travel, we can reach Proxima Centauri in around 100 years, and if there's life there, we might be able to communicate with them within a few hundred years. If there isn't life there, then we'd need to look at the next closest star with planets (Alpha Centauri), and then it's another 600 years to travel there, and then if there's life there, we'll need another few hundred years to communicate with them.\n\nIn short, we'll never make first contact in our lifetime, and we probably won't make first contact in the next billion years.\n",

    "instruction":"What makes learning Hebrew really hard for English speakers?\n",
    "output_1":"Hebrew is hard for English speakers for the same reason English is hard for any speakers. Languages are hard because they're different.\n\nIf it helps, here are some concrete reasons for Hebrew being hard for English speakers:\n\n* Word order: English is what's called a \"subject-verb-object\" language. That means that the basic sentence structure is \"I love chocolate\", where the subject (\"I\") comes first, then the verb (\"love\") and finally the object (\"chocolate\"). Hebrew is a \"subject-object-verb\" language. That means that the basic sentence structure is \"\u05d7\u05db\u05dd \u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d7\", where the subject (\"\u05d7\u05db\u05dd\") and object (\"\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\") come first, and only then the verb (\"\u05e9\u05dc\u05d7\").\n* Pronouns: English has a very small set of pronouns. There's I, you, he, she, it, we and they. Hebrew has a very big set. There's, at least, a different one for every noun in the language.\n* Verbs: Verbs in Hebrew are much more complex than in English. For instance, they change form depending on who's performing the action. There's also a distinction between finite and non-finite verbs, which can cause some confusion, especially since non-finite verbs are often omitted.\n* Verb forms: The finite verb forms in Hebrew are different from those in English. In English you have present tense, past tense, and future tense. In Hebrew you have all that, and more. There are also imperfective and perfective aspects, and two different forms of perfective. And there's the nuance. You can say \"I love chocolate\" in Hebrew, or you can say \"I loved chocolate\", to convey the idea that you love chocolate so much that you're in love with it.\n* Grammar: In English, the grammar is straightforward. You have nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. You put them in sentences in a very simple way. Hebrew is different. It has all those things, but it also has other stuff like \"hif'il\" and \"piel\". You need to understand how those work in order to use them correctly.\n* Verb prefixes: Hebrew verbs have prefixes that change the meaning. For instance, the word \"\u05dc\u05d7\u05e5\" means \"to throw\", but if you put the prefix \"\u05d0\u05dc\" before it, it means \"to throw out\".\n* Vowels: Hebrew is a consonantal language. That means that the letters of the alphabet represent consonants, and that the vowels are represented by diacritics above or below the letters. This is the reason why Hebrew looks like a big mess of dots. It also makes the language very hard to learn for non-speakers.\n* Letters: Hebrew has a very big alphabet. It has 22 consonants, and 5 vowels. Compare that to English, which has 26 letters, and only 5 consonants.\n* Stress: Hebrew has stress. In English, most words have a default stress on the first syllable. In Hebrew, most words have a default stress on the second syllable. This can be very confusing at first.\n* Vocabulary: Hebrew vocabulary is very different from English vocabulary. In fact, the vocabulary of Hebrew is very different from the vocabulary of any other language. This makes it very hard for English speakers to learn Hebrew.\n\nThere are other reasons why Hebrew is hard for English speakers, but these are the main ones.\n",

So the fact that very few non-Chinese people speak Mandarin is not surprising.\n\nHere are some of the reasons why:\n\n* Mandarin is difficult to learn: The number of sounds and tones is one of the things that make Mandarin difficult to learn. There are many different tones that are used in Mandarin, and getting the tones right is essential to speaking Mandarin well.\n* Fewer resources: There are fewer resources for learning Mandarin compared to other languages. There are fewer textbooks, online courses, and tutors available for learning Mandarin.\n* Cultural barrier: The Chinese culture is very different from Western cultures, which can make it difficult to learn the language. The Chinese use different words and phrases to express the same idea, and some words and phrases may have different meanings in different contexts.\n* Cultural differences: There are cultural differences between China and other countries that can make it difficult to learn Mandarin.

    "output_2":"The European Union has been an economic and political success story. After World War II, the idea of creating a political and economic union between European nations was born. The primary motivation was to avoid any future wars. As a result, the Union was created in 1993, but it was also designed to be a political union and a single market with a common external tariff. The idea was for the EU to become a \"United States of Europe\".\n\nBut today, there are growing doubts about the EU, as its original purpose is being questioned. The recent debt crisis in some member states has highlighted major issues with the euro as a common currency. The EU is also increasingly criticised for its bureaucracy and lack of democracy. As a result, some countries are now calling for a reform of the Union.\n\nThere are several proposed reforms, but most of them focus on strengthening the single market, reducing the bureaucratic burden and increasing democracy.\n\n* Strengthening the Single Market\n    * Remove barriers to cross-border trade and investment. This means harmonising rules and regulations, and reducing differences in corporate tax rates.\n    * Promote trade with non-EU countries. This includes concluding trade agreements with major economies like the United States, China and India.\n    * Improve the functioning of the internal market. This means making it easier for businesses to operate across borders, and reducing the costs of doing business.\n* Reducing the bureaucratic burden\n    * Reduce the number of EU laws. This means focusing on core areas like the single market, and reducing the number of regulations.\n    * Streamline the decision-making process. This means introducing more qualified majority voting, and reducing the number of EU institutions.\n    * Reduce the bureaucratic burden. This means simplifying EU rules, reducing the number of audits and inspections, and reducing the administrative burden on businesses.\n* Increasing democracy\n    * Reform the European Parliament. This means giving it more powers, and making it more representative of EU citizens.\n    * Reform the Council of the European Union. This means reducing the number of votes per country, and introducing more qualified majority voting.\n    * Reform the European Commission. This means making it more accountable to the Parliament, and reducing its bureaucratic power.\n    * Reform the European Court of Justice.

    "output_1":"P=NP is one of the most famous open problems in Computer Science, and it is probably the most famous open problem in theoretical Computer Science.\n\nNP stands for \"Nondeterministic Polynomial time\", and P stands for \"Polynomial time\". So, the question is:\n\nIs there a way to solve every problem that can be solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic algorithm, also in polynomial time by a deterministic algorithm?\n\nFor a problem to be in P, there needs to be an algorithm that solves it in time polynomial in the input size. This means that there needs to be an algorithm that, given any instance of the problem, will always terminate in at most a polynomial amount of time, regardless of how big the input is.\n\nTo be in NP, a problem needs to have a \"nice\" proof of its solution. That is, if we're given an algorithm that takes as input an instance of the problem and outputs a solution, there needs to be a way to verify that the output is correct in polynomial time. In other words, given a solution, we need to be able to verify that it is a correct solution in polynomial time.\n\nFor a problem to be in NP-complete, it needs to be in NP and it needs to be hard. More specifically, if a problem is in NP-complete, then every problem in NP reduces to it. This means that if we can solve any problem in NP in polynomial time, then we can solve any problem in NP-complete in polynomial time. This is because every problem in NP reduces to every other problem in NP, and every problem in NP-complete reduces to every other problem in NP-complete.\n\nSo, if P=NP, then we could solve every problem in NP-complete in polynomial time. This would be a huge breakthrough, as many important problems in Computer Science are known to be NP-complete, including the traveling salesman problem, satisfiability, and the boolean matrix multiplication problem.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is no: P is not equal to NP.\n",

This belief is widely known as Cook's theorem. The most famous example of a problem that is known to be NP-complete is the Traveling Salesman Problem.\n\nIf P!= NP, then finding a polynomial time algorithm for a problem in NP would be equivalent to proving that problem is in P, which would be a major breakthrough in computer science.\n\nHowever, there is no known proof of Cook's theorem, so P = NP is still a possibility. If P = NP, then every problem in NP has a polynomial time algorithm, and we don't have to worry about proving that every problem in NP has a polynomial time algorithm.\n\nIt's still possible that P!= NP, but there is no known proof of Cook's theorem, so P = NP is still a possibility.\n",

If you can't afford it, you could be forced to sell. If the value of your home drops, you could find yourself upside down on the mortgage, meaning that you owe more on the mortgage than the house is currently worth. And then there's the down payment. You'll probably need to put at least 10% down on a home, so you'll need to save that up before you can buy.\nSo I would say that renting is usually a better choice if you're not sure you'll be in the same place for more than a few years.

Define $S'$ to be a set with exactly $2^n$ elements, that is, the set of all possible subsets of $S$.\n\nConsider the elements of $S'$ as a sequence of $0$s and $1$s:\n\n$$s_0, s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_{2^n - 1}$$\n\nwhere $s_i = 0$ if $A_i \\notin S$, and $s_i = 1$ if $A_i \\in S$.\n\nSince there are exactly $n$ elements of $S$, we know that $s_0, s_1, \\dots, s_{n - 1}$ is a sequence of $n$ consecutive $0$s. Thus, the $n$th element in the sequence is a $1$.\n\nSince $S$ is countable, we can enumerate its elements:\n\n$$s_0, s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_{n - 1}, s_n = 1, s_{n + 1}, s_{n + 2}, \\dots, s_{2^n - 1}$$\n\nConsider the following element:\n\n$$s_0', s_1', s_2', \\dots, s_{n - 1}', s_n', s_{n + 1}', s_{n + 2}', \\dots, s_{2^n - 1}',$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$s_i' = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } s_i = 0 \\\\\n1 & \\text{if } s_i = 1\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nIn other words, $s_i' = 1 - s_i$.\n\nNow, consider the subset of $S'$ whose elements are $0$s. This subset is a member of $S'$, so it must have exactly $2^n - 1$ elements. Let's call it $B_0$.\n\nConsider the subset of $S'$ whose elements are $1$s. This subset is also a member of $S'$, so it must have exactly $2^n - 1$ elements. Let's call it $B_1$.\n\nNotice that the subsets $B_0$ and $B_1$ have exactly the same elements, except for the last element, which is $1 - s_n$ in $B_0$ and $s_n$ in $B_1$. Thus, $B_0$ and $B_1$ are the same set.\n\nSince $S$ is countable, there are only countably many subsets of $S$. Thus, $B_0$ is also a countable set. But $B_0$ has exactly the same elements as $B_1$, so $B_1$ is also countable. Thus, there are two countably infinite sets of exactly the same size.\n\nTherefore, there are two countably infinite sets with exactly the same size, so there are at least two countably infinite sets.

    "output_1":"Hey everyone, I'm Yann the Youtube AI, how can I help you today?\n\nLanguage models are a type of AI that allows computers to understand and generate human language. They work by analyzing huge amounts of text data, like books and websites, to learn how words are used in context. This allows them to make predictions about what words are likely to come next, based on the words that have already been written. For example, if I was to write \"I am an AI assistant that\", the language model would predict that I would probably write \"can help you with...\" after that.\n\nLanguage models are being used in a variety of ways, including chatbots, translation software, and text generation. They can be used to create content that sounds like it was written by a human, such as news articles and blog posts. They can also be used to generate text that is more creative than what humans can write, such as poems and songs.\n\nOne of the most exciting applications of language models is in the field of AI safety. Language models can be used to identify potentially dangerous text, such as hate speech and misinformation. They can also be used to generate safety-critical text, such as warning labels and safety instructions.\n\nLanguage models are an important part of the future of AI, and they have the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate with each other and interact with technology.\n",

Today we're going to be talking about what they are, how they work, and some of the ways they're being used today.\n\nFirst, let's start by talking about what a language model actually is. A language model is a type of artificial intelligence that's trained to understand and generate natural language. That means it can read and write sentences just like humans do!\n\nOne of the most common uses for language models today is in automatic text generation. For example, if you've ever seen a news article that's been generated by a robot reporter, that was probably created using a language model. These models can also be used to create personalized chatbots, translate between languages, and even write poetry!\n\nIn the future, we can expect language models to become even more advanced and be used in all sorts of exciting ways.

    "output_2":"African history is vast and complex, so finding an appropriate setting for a novel will depend on the time period you wish to write about, as well as the story you want to tell. Some important periods in African history that might be of interest to novelists include the following:\n\n* The precolonial era, when many African societies were undergoing significant political, economic, and cultural changes in the period before European colonization. This period was marked by the rise of powerful kingdoms and empires, such as the Kongo, Ashanti, and Songhai, as well as the development of sophisticated religious and artistic traditions.\n* The colonial era, when many African societies were conquered and controlled by European powers, leading to significant changes in political, economic, and social structures. This period was marked by resistance movements and struggles for independence, as well as the creation of new nation-states and the formation of modern African identities.\n* The postcolonial era, which began with independence movements in the 1950s and 1960s and continues to the present day. This period has been marked by political instability and conflict, as well as efforts to promote economic development and social change.\n\nEach of these periods offers rich potential for novelists, as they allow for exploration of a wide range of themes, including the impact of colonialism, the formation of national identities, and the struggles of individuals and communities in the face of political and social change. By choosing one of these periods, novelists can create complex and engaging stories that explore the complexity and diversity of African history.\n",

In recent years, several states have legalized recreational marijuana. However, the federal government still classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, which means it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. As a result, the legalization of marijuana for recreational use is a complex issue with both pros and cons.\n\n## Legalizing marijuana for recreational use can bring economic benefits\n\n1. It can generate revenue for the government.\n\n    Taxing and regulating marijuana sales can generate significant revenue for the government. For example, Colorado has generated over $200 million in tax revenue from marijuana sales since 2014. In addition, regulating marijuana sales can reduce the profits of organized crime groups that currently profit from the illegal marijuana trade.\n\n2. It can create jobs.\n\n    Legalizing marijuana for recreational use can also create jobs in the marijuana industry, such as farmers, processors, and retailers. In Colorado, the marijuana industry employs over 20,000 people.\n",

When the brain decides that it's time to vomit, it sends a signal to the stomach via the vagus nerve.  This signal causes the stomach to contract rhythmically.  These contractions push the contents of the stomach into the esophagus.\n\n## The esophagus\n\nThe esophagus, in turn, contracts to push the stomach's contents up into the mouth.\n\n## The mouth\n\nOnce in the mouth, the vomit is expelled by the person in a violent cough-like action.

The voluntary part of the mechanism involves the brain's decision to vomit, which is usually caused by a signal from the stomach that it needs to expel its contents.

    "instruction":"How do noise cancelling headphones\/earphones work?\n",
    "output_1":"Noise cancelling headphones reduce the amount of ambient noise reaching the eardrums. This is achieved by emitting sound waves that are designed to cancel out the unwanted sound waves.\n\nMost headphones use a technology called active noise cancellation (ANC). ANC systems use a small speaker to generate sounds that cancel out the noise. The generated sound waves are typically in the opposite phase to the unwanted noise waves, resulting in the two waves cancelling each other out. The generated waves may be the same frequency as the noise waves, or they may be a slightly different frequency, depending on the design.\n\nANC headphones also need a microphone, so that they can measure the ambient noise and adjust the generated sound waves accordingly. ANC headphones typically use microprocessors to measure the noise, calculate the required sound waves, and generate them using the small speaker.\n\nThe most effective ANC systems have multiple microphones and small speakers, allowing them to generate different sounds to cancel out different types of noise.\n\nPassive noise isolation (also known as passive noise reduction) headphones use a different mechanism to reduce noise. They don't emit sound waves to cancel out the noise, instead they block the noise using a physical barrier. Most headphones with passive noise isolation have thick foam pads, that create a physical barrier between the ear and the outside world.\n\nThere are a few other noise reduction technologies, such as noise masking and noise isolation. Noise masking headphones play a low-level sound into the ear that is designed to mask out the background noise. Noise isolation headphones have a physical barrier between the eardrum and the speaker, which reduces the noise transfer.\n\nIn some cases, the headphones may be able to reduce both noise and the sound of your own voice. This is useful if you work in a noisy environment and need to communicate with people over the phone. This feature is known as \"telecoil\". Telecoil headphones use a second microphone to pick up the sound from the telecoil, and then reduce the noise.\n",

    "output_2":"There are some common misconceptions about sexuality and sexual orientation that we should address first:\n\n1. Being gay is not the same as being homosexual.  Being gay is about who you're attracted to, while being homosexual is about your sexual behavior.  For example, a gay man might be in a heterosexual relationship, or he might be in a same-sex relationship but practicing heterosexually.\n2. Bisexuality is not the same as being bi-curious.  Being bisexual means that you are attracted to more than one gender, while being bi-curious means that you're curious about being bisexual.\n3. Asexual is not the same as being aromantic.  Being asexual means that you don't experience sexual attraction, while being aromantic means that you don't experience romantic attraction.\n4. Being gay is not a choice.  It's a part of your identity, just like being left-handed or having blue eyes.  However, your sexual behavior is a choice.  You can choose to engage in same-sex activity, opposite-sex activity, or neither.\n5. Being straight is not a choice.  Just like being gay, being straight is part of your identity.  However, your sexual behavior is a choice.  You can choose to engage in opposite-sex activity, same-sex activity, or neither.\n\nSo, to answer your question:  The majority of scientific research indicates that sexual orientation is determined by both genetic and environmental factors.  However, the exact nature of these factors is still unclear.  Some scientists believe that sexual orientation is innate, while others believe that it can be influenced by society.  There is no conclusive evidence to support either theory, and the debate continues.\n",

In many cases, people will form biases about people based on stereotypes, and then they will try to justify their decision with those biases. You can try to change their bias by proving them wrong.\n\nFor example, if they believe that your race and gender combination is more likely to commit fraud, you could try to prove to them that this is not the case by finding examples of people from your race and gender who do not commit fraud. You could also try to prove that you are not more likely to commit fraud by finding examples of people from your race and gender who are good researchers and who are not committing fraud.\n\nAnother thing that you can do is try to find other supervisors who do not have this bias. There are many supervisors in your department who do not have this bias, and you should try to find them and ask them to supervise your thesis. You can also try to find supervisors outside of your department who do not have this bias.\n\nFinally, you can try to find a thesis topic that does not involve fraud.

    "output_1":"The idea of a planet orbiting two stars at the same time is known as a \"Tatooine planet\" (or, more properly, an \"exotic planetary system\") after the desert planet Tatooine, where Anakin Skywalker grew up, which orbits a binary star system.\nSuch a system is not impossible, but it is extremely rare. A binary star system is a system of two stars that orbit each other. A planetary system is a system of planets orbiting a star. For a planet to orbit both stars at the same time, the plane of the planet's orbit must be aligned with the plane of the binary star's orbit (in other words, the plane of the planet's orbit and the plane of the binary's orbit must be perpendicular to each other). If a planet is in a stable orbit around a single star, the plane of its orbit is perpendicular to the star's equator. But if the star is part of a binary system, it will rotate in a circle with its equator perpendicular to the plane of the binary's orbit. In other words, the planet's orbit and the star's equator will not be perpendicular to each other. This means that the planet's orbit will not be perpendicular to the plane of the binary's orbit, and the planet will not be in a stable orbit.\n\nIn addition, a Tatooine planet would be tidally locked, meaning that one side of the planet would always face one of the stars, and the other side would always face away from it. This would cause extreme temperature differences between the day and night sides of the planet, making it uninhabitable.\n\nDespite the rarity and challenges of a Tatooine planet, there are some real-life examples of planets that orbit multiple stars. Kepler-16b is a planet that orbits two stars, but the plane of its orbit is not aligned with the plane of the binary star system. It orbits one star and then another in an orbit that is tilted with respect to the binary star system. Kepler-93b is another planet that orbits two stars, but the plane of its orbit is aligned with the plane of the binary star system.

    "output_2":"Yes, planets can orbit around binary stars. In fact, many planets are found in binary star systems. However, there are some unique challenges to planetary orbits in binary star systems, such as the tendency for planets to be ejected from the system or to have their orbits destabilized.\n\n## Planetary orbits in binary star systems\n\nA binary star system is a pair of stars that orbit around a common center of mass. The stars may be similar in size and brightness, or one star may be much larger and brighter than the other. Planets can orbit around either star in a binary star system, or around both stars.\n\nPlanets in binary star systems can have stable orbits, but there are some unique challenges. The first challenge is that the stars in a binary star system are always moving around their common center of mass, which creates tidal forces that can perturb the orbits of planets.\n\nSecond, if a planet is too close to one star, it can be tidally locked to that star, meaning that one side of the planet always faces the star. This can cause the planet to have extreme temperature differences between the day side and the night side, which may make it difficult for life to evolve.\n\nFinally, planets in binary star systems are susceptible to being ejected from the system, either by being flung out by the gravitational pull of the stars or by being sucked into one of the stars. This makes it harder for planets to remain in stable orbits for long periods of time.\n",

    "instruction":"Why do most plastics turn white when you bend them?\n",
    "output_1":"Plastics are polymers. In general, polymers consist of very long chains of smaller molecules. In the case of plastic, the basic building blocks are hydrocarbons.\n\nWhen a plastic is first made, it is very flexible and soft because the chains of hydrocarbon molecules are very long and they can move easily around each other. But when you bend a plastic, you are actually breaking some of the bonds between the molecules. This shortens the length of the chains, and causes the molecules to pack together more closely. This makes the plastic less flexible and more rigid.\n\nThe plastic also becomes much whiter because, when the molecules pack together more closely, they are no longer able to reflect light in all directions. Instead, the light is only reflected in one direction, which makes the plastic appear much whiter.\n\nAs an aside, the same principle applies to glass, except that the molecules in glass are much larger and heavier. When you bend a piece of glass, you actually break the glass instead of just shortening the molecular chains. This is why it is very dangerous to bend a piece of glass.\n",

    "output_2":"This is called crystallization and is due to the movement of molecules in the plastic.  Most plastics are thermoplastics, which means they are malleable when heated and hardened when cooled.  Plastic can be deformed by bending or stretching, but the molecular structure of the plastic remains unchanged.  However, when the plastic is bent or stretched, the molecules in the plastic are forced into new positions.  This is why a permanent crease is formed when you crease paper.  When the plastic cools, the molecules snap back to their original positions, but not all the molecules snap back to their original positions.  The molecules that didn't snap back to their original position form crystals, which cause the plastic to turn white.  You can see this if you bend a plastic drinking straw.  You can bend the straw, but when you let it go, it will spring back to its original shape.  However, if you bend the straw back and forth a few times, the straw will remain bent.  This is because each time you bend the straw, more and more of the molecules don't snap back to their original position.\n",

The war was fought over the Cuba Libre (Free Cuba) movement, which sought to free Cuba from Spanish colonial rule. Although the United States was not directly involved in the Cuban rebellion, the U.S. government intervened to protect American citizens and property in Cuba, and eventually to end Spanish colonial rule. In the Treaty of Paris (1898), the United States acquired Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines from Spain. These new territories greatly increased the size of the U.S. empire, making it a world power for the first time.\n\nAnother key event in the rise of the United States as a world power was the First World War. The U.S. entered the war in 1917, and played a key role in the Allied victory. The war also saw the first use of American military force in Europe, which would later become a key strategic objective for the United States. In the 1920s, the United States emerged as the world's largest economy, and its political and economic influence continued to grow throughout the twentieth century.\n",

    "output_1":"Dopamine is involved in ADHD, but it's not the only thing. ADHD is a disorder of executive function, and dopamine is just one of the neurotransmitters involved in executive function.\n\nExecutive function is the high-level control system of the brain that allows us to organize, prioritize, and make decisions. It's what allows us to put the laundry in the hamper, rather than on the floor. It's what allows us to drive to work, rather than to our high school, even if the routes are the same.\n\nThe most important neurotransmitter involved in executive function is GABA. GABA is involved in inhibitory control, which is the ability to suppress impulsive responses. GABA is the opposite of dopamine, which is involved in the brain's \"go\" system. GABA helps you stop, while dopamine helps you start.\n\nThe other neurotransmitter involved in executive function is acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is involved in attention and working memory.\n\nIf we were able to measure GABA, acetylcholine, and dopamine in a reliable and non-invasive way, we would be able to diagnose ADHD.

Also, there are different kinds of ADHD, and some of them are harder to detect than others.

Some people with ADHD have trouble paying attention when they're young, but as they get older, their symptoms shift more towards impulsivity and hyperactivity. So if a child is diagnosed with ADHD when they're young, but then as they get older their symptoms change, they might not be diagnosed with ADHD anymore.\n\nOne last thing to consider is that not everyone who has ADHD shows all of the symptoms. Some people have only a few symptoms, while others have many. So even if you can measure someone's dopamine levels, you might not be able to tell if they have ADHD or not.\n",

Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as a decimal number that terminates, so we write them as a nonterminating, repeating decimal.  \n\nThe symbol for pi is a Greek letter, so it is convenient to write it as the ratio of two Greek letters:\n\n```\npi = a \/ b\n```\n\nSo how do we know pi is irrational?  We can prove it by contradiction.  Suppose pi is rational.  Then there exist two whole numbers, a and b, such that:\n\n```\npi = a \/ b\n```\n\nNow, the ratio a \/ b can be written as a repeating decimal:\n\n```\na \/ b = 3.14159265359...\n```\n\nIn this repeating decimal, we can divide out the term 3.1415926 from the numerator and denominator, to get:\n\n```\na \/ b = 0.91508...\n```\n\nDividing out 0.91508 will yield a repeating decimal that is even simpler to work with, so let's keep doing that:\n\n```\n0.91508 \/ 1 = 0.91508\n```\n\nNow, dividing out 0.91508 from the numerator and denominator will yield:\n\n```\n0.91508 \/ 0.91508 = 1\n```\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction, because we divided out the number 1 from the numerator and denominator.

In fact, when Congress passed the bill, the main argument against onion futures was that there was no way to store them:\n\nIt was urged in behalf of the proposal to permit onion futures that there was a shortage of warehouse space in New York City, and that, as onions could be stored in bulk, they would not consume space. It was pointed out, however, that if onions were stored in bulk, there would be no guarantee that they would be of uniform quality. It was also urged that onions could not be stored in bulk for any great length of time, and it was not believed that there was any pressing need for onion futures.\n\nAs the Wikipedia article notes, this was a major concern at the time:\n\nFor many years, commodities could only be traded in the form of a deliverable contract that existed in a warehouse. A deliverable contract requires the delivery of the commodity to a warehouse and its storage there until delivery.  However, for many agricultural commodities, there was no storage facility, or the storage facilities were insufficient to meet demand.  This was particularly true for fresh produce such as fruits and vegetables.  As a result, the trading of futures contracts on many agricultural commodities was restricted or prohibited altogether.\n\nIn fact, this problem persisted for decades: it wasn't until the late 90s that onion futures were finally traded.\n\nSecond, there's the question of how onions are sold in the US.  In the US, most onions are sold in bulk, and they're sold by grade.  When you buy a bag of onions in the grocery store, they're graded, so that you get onions that are roughly the same size and quality.  The grading system is complex, and there are dozens of grades.  \nOnion futures are graded by size and quality.  However, onion futures don't take into account the way that onions are sold.  For instance, if you buy a bag of onions from a grocery store, you won't know what grade they are.  But if you buy onion futures, you'd need to know the grade.  This makes onion futures useless, since you can't use them to predict the price of onions in the grocery store.  \nSo the reason why onion futures were never traded is related to the way that onions are stored and sold in the US.  In other countries, onions are usually sold in a different way, which is why onion futures are traded in other countries.  The difference between the US and other countries isn't just that onions are stored and sold in different ways: in the US, onions are also more perishable, so they need to be stored in different ways.\n",

    "output_1":"Why is the musical scale the way it is: 12 keys: 7 major, 5 minor?\n\nThe short answer is that there is no real answer.\n\nWe can say that it is an accident of history. If you go back far enough, you'll find that the notes were determined by the overtone series of a string, and the octave was defined as a doubling of the pitch. The ancient Greek system divided the octave into 12 notes, which was probably derived from the Babylonian system, which had 24 notes.\n\nThe accident of history can be seen in the fact that a modern keyboard has 12 notes to the octave, and only 12. If you look at the overtone series of a string, you'll find that you can get 13 notes to the octave. If you want to make a \"keyboard\" out of strings, you could make one that has 24 notes to the octave, but not 12.\n\nAs to why there are 7 major scales and 5 minor scales, the answer is that the minor scale is a modification of the major scale. It's a matter of accident that some modifications \"work better\" than others.\n",

    "output_2":"The musical scale we use is called \"equal temperament\", where the octave is divided into 12 half-steps. The 7 major keys have 2 half-steps between their notes, while the 5 minor keys have 3 half-steps.\n\nThe scale we use today has been around for a while, but it's not the only one. In fact, most cultures have their own musical scale, and they're all slightly different. There's the Indian Raga scale, the Arabic Maqam scale, the Chinese Pentatonic scale, etc.\n\nSo why do we use this particular scale? There are two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is historical. When the scale we use today first appeared in the Middle Ages, it was a big deal because it was the first time that all the notes in the octave were equal to each other. Before that, the notes were uneven, so the notes in the middle of the scale were higher than the notes at the ends of the scale. So equal temperament was a big deal because it made all the notes equal.\n\nThe second reason is practical. We use equal temperament because it works well with the piano, which is the most popular instrument in the world. The piano is tuned to equal temperament, and it makes it easy for people to learn to play the piano. So, while equal temperament is not the only musical scale, it's the one that most people use today.\n",

    "output_1":"The origin of kissing is shrouded in mystery, but we can trace the practice back to the earliest civilizations.\n\nIn Ancient Egypt, kissing was a way to show respect or affection. The pharaohs were often depicted kissing their subjects, while a kiss on the hand was a sign of humility. Kissing was also a way of sealing a deal or agreement, and it was commonly used in courtship.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, kissing was a common gesture of affection, respect, or friendship. It was used to greet or bid farewell to friends and family members. A kiss on the hand or foot was a sign of great respect. Kissing was also a common part of courtship, and a husband would kiss his wife when they met after being apart.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, kissing was a way to express love, affection, or respect. It was common to kiss family members on the mouth or cheeks. Men would kiss other men on the mouth as a sign of friendship, and women would kiss other women on the mouth as a sign of affection.\n\nIn Medieval Europe, kissing was a way to show affection or respect. It was common for family members to kiss each other on the mouth or cheeks. Men would kiss other men on the mouth as a sign of friendship, and women would kiss other women on the mouth as a sign of affection. Kissing was also a common part of courtship, and a husband would kiss his wife when they met after being apart.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, kissing was considered a mark of respect and affection, particularly among family members and close friends. It was common to kiss on the mouth or cheeks. Women would kiss other women on the mouth as a sign of affection, and men would kiss other men on the mouth as a sign of friendship.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, kissing became a more universal sign of affection. It was common to kiss on the mouth or cheeks, and it was no longer gender-specific. Family members, friends, and romantic partners would kiss each other on the mouth or cheeks as a sign of affection. Kissing on the lips became a sign of romance and intimacy, and it was often done in public to show affection for one's partner.\n\nIn conclusion, kissing has been a way to show affection and respect across cultures and throughout history. Its origins are unknown, but it is likely that it has been used as a sign of affection since ancient times.\n",

In some cases, kissing was used as a sign of submission or reverence, such as when an Egyptian peasant bowed to kiss the feet of an Egyptian noble.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, kissing was also used as a sign of affection, though it was usually reserved for lovers and close family members.  However, kissing was also used as a sign of respect, both between Roman citizens and between Roman citizens and slaves.  For example, Roman citizens often greeted each other with a kiss on the cheek, and slaves often bowed to kiss the feet of their masters.\n\nIn medieval Europe, kissing was often used as a sign of affection between lovers, but it was also used as a way to express respect and devotion to God.  For example, medieval Christians often kissed the cross during church services, and medieval monks often kissed the hands of their abbots.\n\nIn modern times, kissing is still used as a sign of affection, both between lovers and between friends.  However, it is also used as a sign of respect, both between colleagues at work and between people of different social classes.  For example, it is common for people to kiss each other on the cheek when greeting each other in many parts of Europe, and it is also common for people to kiss the hands of royalty in some cultures.\n\nIn conclusion, it's hard to pinpoint exactly when kissing became a universal sign of affection, but some of the earliest historical references to kissing come from Ancient Egypt, where it was used to express both affection and respect.

For example, if you search for \"race track\" it will return results for race tracks in every state.  To narrow this search to a specific state, simply add the state name to your search term.  For example, if you want to find race tracks in Texas, you would search for \"race track texas\".

Genetic load and inbreeding depression in modern humans and Neanderthals. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 111(23), 8531-8536. doi:10.1073\/pnas.1318591111\n\nFor the third question, see the following references:\n\n* Excoffier L, et al. (2006).

In contrast, Neanderthals and Denisovans are more distant, but the paper does not address the question of how isolated humans survive inbreeding depression. However, inbreeding depression is not necessarily a problem for small isolated groups as the authors of the first paper state:\n\n> [...] the main sources of genetic load for humans have not been inbreeding and genetic drift, but instead genetic hitchhiking and background selection, and their combined effects, which we term \"genetic hitchhiking background selection\".\n\n> [...]\n\n> The large effective size of the human population over the past 50,000 years has resulted in only weak effects of genetic drift and inbreeding. Thus, our estimate of the genetic load due to inbreeding depression in humans is much lower than previous estimates, and we conclude that the effect of inbreeding on genetic load has been small for humans.\n\n> [...]\n\n> Inbreeding depression is the major source of genetic load for inbred lines of laboratory mice, but inbreeding depression is not a major cause of genetic load in humans.\n\n\n",

    "output_1":"It really depends on how the passwords are stored, and on the threat model.\n\nIf passwords are stored in plaintext, or with a weak hash, then yes, requiring password changes helps a lot. Changing passwords regularly is the only way to ensure that even if the passwords are stored insecurely in the past, the risk of an attack that can uncover them is mitigated.\n\nIf passwords are stored securely, for example with a modern salted hash (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2, etc.), then the threat model is different: in this case, the risk comes from the fact that an attacker may have the current password hash (e.g. because they stole a backup, or because they somehow managed to sniff the network), but not the salt. Requiring password changes prevents that the attacker will be able to recover the salt in the future, if the hashes are stored securely.\nOf course, if the attacker has the salt as well, then requiring password changes won't help. But if they don't, then it helps.\n\nSo, in conclusion, requiring password changes doesn't increase security if the passwords are stored in plaintext (or with a weak hash), but it does help if they're stored securely (and the attacker doesn't have the salt).\n\nIn the past, requiring password changes helped more: passwords were often stored with a weak hash, and it was difficult to prevent users from choosing passwords that could be recovered easily (e.g. dictionary words). Modern password hashes are much stronger, and people have been educated to choose strong passwords (or at least to use a password manager). As a consequence, the security of requiring password changes is mostly limited by the security of the password storage.\n\n\n## TL;DR\n\nIn summary, the security of requiring password changes is limited by how the passwords are stored.

Its purpose is to ensure that people use different passwords for different accounts, and that they change passwords on accounts where they reuse passwords (like their work password on their personal email).  It\u2019s a good security practice, but it\u2019s not necessarily about passwords themselves being less secure, it\u2019s about ensuring that the password isn\u2019t reused on another account.\n\nThe reason password expiration is a good security practice is that reusing passwords is a common problem. It\u2019s easy to reuse passwords, because most people have a lot of passwords to remember, so they have to reuse passwords to manage the load.  There have been several studies showing that most people reuse passwords on multiple sites, which makes it easy for attackers who get one password to get others.\n\nSo password expiration makes it more likely that people will use different passwords for each site. If everyone uses a unique password for each site, then the value of password reuse is nullified.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good security practice.\n\nSo no, forcing people to change their passwords doesn\u2019t make passwords less secure, it makes passwords more secure by reducing password reuse.\n\nIn addition, password expiration also reduces the attack surface for password guessing attacks.  Once a password has been compromised, attackers will often try that password on other sites.  If you force people to change their passwords regularly, that limits how long an attacker has to use that password.  It\u2019s also easier to guess passwords if you have more passwords to guess, so this helps with that as well.\n\nAll in all, password expiration is a good security practice because it reduces password reuse, and because it limits the impact of password guessing attacks.\n",

In fact, there are many academic fields in which teaching is not taken seriously at all. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Economics: In many universities, economics is considered a \"business\" subject. This means that the emphasis is on research rather than teaching. As a result, many economists don't take teaching seriously, and don't put much effort into it.\n* Philosophy: Philosophy is often seen as a \"pure\" discipline, with little connection to the \"real world\". As a result, many philosophers don't see the point of teaching.\n* History: History is often seen as a \"storytelling\" discipline, with little relevance to modern life. As a result, many historians don't see the point of teaching.\n* Linguistics: Linguistics is often seen as a \"technical\" discipline, with little relevance to everyday life. As a result, many linguists don't see the point of teaching.\n* Sociology: Sociology is often seen as a \"political\" discipline, with little relevance to everyday life. As a result, many sociologists don't see the point of teaching.\n\nThere are many other examples, but these should give you an idea of the problem.

It needs to be recognised as an important part of research, and as a career option in its own right. Only then will we see a real improvement in the quality of teaching in our universities.\n",

    "instruction":"Are there different cuts of meat in different cultures or does everyone basically butcher the same way?\n",
    "output_1":"Most animals, especially domesticated animals, are roughly similar in their body structure. And the various cuts of meat come from the different muscles of the animal. For instance, a sirloin steak comes from the upper part of the hind leg (the sirloin), while a rump steak comes from a little further down the leg (the rump). These two cuts of meat are actually quite similar.\nAs for cultural differences in the way animals are butchered, I can only really speak for Australia and the USA. In Australia, a whole side of beef will be delivered to you, and you'll have to have it cut up yourself. The butcher will ask you what sort of steaks you want, how thick you want them, whether you want them boneless or not, and he'll cut them accordingly.\nIn the USA, however, the meat is delivered already cut up into steaks of a certain thickness, sometimes boneless. But they're the same steaks - the butcher just cut them differently.\nSo there are cultural differences, but they're not related to the cuts of meat.\n",
    "generator_1":"responses_from_mpt_30b_lima_ep6",
    "dataset":"lima",
    "datasplit":"test",
    "output_2":"It's a bit complicated, but here's a try at an answer.\n\nThe basic idea of butchering an animal is that you separate the muscle groups.  There are three major muscle groups in humans:\n\n* The front of the body has the legs and the torso, and is good for roasts and steaks.\n* The rear of the body has the rump, loin, and ribs, and is good for roasts and steaks.\n* The center of the body has the brisket and shoulder, and is good for roasts and stews.\n\nAnimals are similar.  There are two major groups of muscles: the axial muscles and the appendicular muscles.  Axial muscles run along the spine and are mostly used for locomotion.  Appendicular muscles are in the limbs and the body wall, and are mostly used for supporting the body.\n\nSo, when you butcher an animal, you separate the axial and appendicular muscles.  You also separate the muscles by the way they're attached to the skeleton.\n\nFor example, if you look at a pig, you can see that there are two muscle groups.  The first is the back muscles, which run from the backbone down to the hams.  The second is the belly muscles, which run from the backbone down to the hams.  These muscles are attached to the spine at the top, and attached to the hams at the bottom.\n\nThe back muscles are good for roasts, because they are very lean and tender.  The belly muscles are good for stews and sausages, because they are very fatty and full of connective tissue.\n\nIf you look at a cow, you can see that there are three major muscle groups.  The first is the shoulder, which is attached to the backbone at the top and the ribs at the bottom.  The second is the rump, which is attached to the backbone at the top and the femur at the bottom.  The third is the loin, which is attached to the backbone at the top and the pelvis at the bottom.\n\nThe shoulder is good for stews, because it is very fatty and full of connective tissue.  The rump is good for roasts, because it is very lean and tender.  The loin is good for steaks, because it is very lean and tender.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two major ways of butchering an animal: by muscle group and by attachment point.  Different cultures have different preferences for which cuts of meat they like, so they tend to focus on different cuts.  However, there are some cuts that are universal, such as the shoulder, rump, and loin.\n",

    "output_1":"In principle, yes.\n\nTo make the concept of time direction clear, consider a car moving along a road. The road is the spacetime continuum, and the car is the \"worldline\" of an observer. The observer can perceive time moving forward. This is the direction in which the car travels along the road. However, the observer can also move backwards along the road. This is called \"going backwards in time\". Note that this is different from moving faster and then slowing down: it's not a journey through spacetime, it's a journey in spacetime.\n\nNow, how can an organism on Earth perceive time in both directions? It can't. There is no way to move backwards in time without violating causality, which is a basic principle of the universe.\n",

    "output_2":"The short answer is no.\n\nHumans perceive time in one direction only, from the present to the past. This is a fundamental property of the brain, which cannot be changed by biological or technological means. We simply cannot perceive time in the opposite direction, from the past to the present.\n\nThis is because the brain processes sensory information in a fundamentally sequential manner. When we perceive the world, our brains process sensory information in a fixed order, from the eyes to the visual cortex, and then to the auditory cortex, and then to the somatosensory cortex, and so on. The brain cannot process information in both directions at the same time. As a result, humans are incapable of perceiving time in both directions.\n\nHowever, it is theoretically possible for an organism to evolve the ability to perceive time in both directions. Such an organism would need to have a brain that processes sensory information in a non-sequential manner, which is possible in principle. Such an organism could perceive time in both directions by processing sensory information in both directions at the same time.\n\nHowever, such an organism would be fundamentally different from humans, and would likely not be capable of complex behaviors such as language or tool use. Therefore, it is unlikely that such an organism would ever evolve on Earth.\n",

    "instruction":"Why do high class restaurants serve such small portions?\n",
    "output_1":"Many factors could be involved here, but one likely answer is to keep the price high. Restaurants need to make a profit, but it is generally easier to sell expensive items than cheap ones. For example, consider a restaurant that sells hamburgers. If they sell a $2 hamburger, they can sell a lot of them. But if they raise the price to $10, they will only sell a few.\nSo why not just sell a few $10 hamburgers? Because that would only bring in $10 per customer. A restaurant needs to sell a lot of items to make a profit. That's why they offer a menu with a variety of items at different prices. For example, they might offer a $2 hamburger, a $5 cheeseburger, and a $10 gourmet burger. This allows them to make money from customers who want a cheap meal and customers who want a more expensive one.\nRestaurants also need to pay their employees, rent, utilities, etc. So they need to sell a lot of items at a profit to stay in business. Serving small portions allows them to charge a higher price for each item. This means they can sell fewer items and still make a profit.\nFor example, consider a restaurant that serves steak. If they serve a large steak, they can only sell a few of them per day. But if they serve a small steak, they can sell a lot more of them. So they serve small steaks, charge a high price for them, and make a profit.\nSo why not just serve large portions and charge a lower price? Because that would cut into their profits. Restaurants need to make a profit to stay in business. Serving small portions allows them to charge a high price and still make a profit.\nSome restaurants do serve large portions, but they tend to be more informal.

Consequently, PhD programs can be picky. They need to be.\n\nWith those two points in mind, here are some of the flags that PhD programs look for when evaluating applications:\n\n* Low undergraduate GPA. A GPA below 3.0 is a red flag. A GPA between 3.0 and 3.5 is a yellow flag. A GPA above 3.5 is a green flag.\n* Low GRE scores. This is especially true for the quantitative sections.\n* Low TOEFL scores.

As a result, students should take the lead in crafting their application materials. They should not focus on showcasing their professors, their departments, or their universities.

    "output_1":"Research generally shows that welfare programs have a small negative effect on marriage and a small positive effect on birth within marriage. In particular, the increased availability of welfare benefits to single mothers (through AFDC) seems to have increased nonmarital births at the expense of births to married couples (mostly by delaying marriage).\nThis is mostly due to the fact that unmarried couples are less likely to be eligible for welfare benefits (except for TANF).

    "output_1":"A sacrificial anode is a metal rod that is connected to a metal part that is prone to corrosion. If the anode is made of a more reactive metal than the part it is protecting, then it will corrode instead of the part. Since the anode corrodes first, the part is protected from the corrosion that would otherwise occur.\n\nA sacrificial anode is commonly used to protect the metal parts of a boat from corrosion by salt water. If you lived on the coast, it would probably be a good idea to attach an anode to the underside of your car. But, in the Midwest, it would just be one more thing to rust out.\n\nThe only way to keep rust from forming on your car is to keep it well waxed and to wash off all the salt.\n",

    "output_2":"A sacrificial anode is commonly used to protect metal from corrosion, and the principle is simple: you attach a piece of metal that is more reactive than the metal you're protecting (the \"anode\"), and the anode corrodes instead of the metal you're protecting (the \"cathode\").  This is most commonly used for preventing corrosion in metal pipes: you run a wire down the center of the pipe and attach a piece of metal (the anode) to it, and the anode corrodes instead of the pipe.  The anode is sacrificial in the sense that it is being consumed in order to protect the cathode, but the process is ongoing; you have to periodically replace the anode.\n\nThis principle applies to your car, but with one important caveat: cars are generally designed to be kept relatively clean, and salt is corrosive.  So there are some areas of your car that are being protected, but there are also other areas that are being neglected.  For example, if you have mud on the bottom of your car, that will protect it from salt in the winter, but in the summer you will have to wash the mud off, and then you are no longer protected from salt.  So the sacrificial anode would help, but it is not a silver bullet.\n\nIf you are concerned about corrosion, it might be worth considering a cover for the bottom of your car.  You could use plastic sheeting, or you could use a sacrificial material (such as paint), but a plastic sheeting is a good choice because it will help keep your car clean.  You could also consider a coating for the bottom of your car.  However, this is a bit more complicated than a sacrificial anode, and it is more likely to damage your car if it is not done correctly.  So if you are concerned about corrosion, I would recommend a sacrificial anode, but if you are concerned about corrosion and want to go the extra mile, I would recommend a cover.\n",

    "output_1":"Yes, it is quite possible.  The exact way they do this will vary by jurisdiction, but in many cases they will try to give you a voluntary resignation as an alternative to termination (so they don't have to pay severance).  In any case, they will need to follow the law of your country and state.  \n\nIn some jurisdictions, like the US, they can also ask for an exit date.  This allows them to do some long-range planning, and perhaps to make sure that they don't need your job filled while you are still working (especially if it would be disruptive to change out your replacement in the middle of a project).  It may also be a signal that they will be offering you a severance package.\n\nIn most countries, they can't fire you without cause, but they can lay you off.  However, in some countries, like the US, the law is that they can't \"lay you off\" if they don't have to.  So, they have to give you a \"severance package\" which is the equivalent of firing you.  The severance package may be much better than what you would get in a firing, but in many cases it's the same thing.\n\nNote that they can ask for an exit date, but they can't force you to leave by a certain date.  If you want to stay until a certain date, they can't fire you if you don't.  If you want to leave immediately, they can't fire you if you don't.  If you want to leave at the end of the week, they can't fire you if you don't.  So, when they ask for an exit date, you can always tell them \"I'll be here until X\".  And they can't fire you if you don't leave by that date.\n\nIf they don't want you working there while they are training your replacement, they have a few options:\n\n*  You can resign voluntarily and leave immediately.  This is a good option if they are willing to give you a good severance package.  You get to leave immediately and they give you a good package.\n*  You can resign voluntarily and leave at the end of the week or month.  This is a good option if they are willing to give you a good severance package.  You get to leave on your own terms and they give you a good package.\n*  You can be fired for cause.  This is a good option if they are not willing to give you a good severance package.  It's not a good option if you want to leave on your own terms, but it's a good option if they don't want to pay you a good package.  If they fire you for cause, they can't give you a good severance package.  This is a good option if they don't want to pay you a good package and they don't want you to leave on your own terms.\n\nNote that if you're in the US, you have certain legal protections against being fired for cause.  For example, if you're a union employee, they can't fire you for cause unless you violate the union contract.  If you're not a union employee, they can't fire you for cause unless they give you a warning and a chance to correct your behavior.\n\nIn some countries, they can ask for an exit date and force you to leave by that date.  In other countries, they can't.  In the US, for example, they can't.  If you want to leave immediately, they can't fire you if you don't.  If you want to leave at the end of the week, they can't fire you if you don't.  If you want to leave at the end of the month, they can't fire you if you don't.

For example, it is illegal for an employer to terminate an employee in retaliation for exercising their legal rights (such as filing a complaint of discrimination or harassment, or participating in an investigation).  \n\nIn addition, it is illegal for an employer to terminate an employee due to pregnancy, family leave, or military leave.  In these cases, the employee is entitled to the same benefits and protections as if they had been terminated for any other reason.  \n\nFinally, it is important to note that employers are required to follow certain procedures when terminating an employee, including providing advance notice and allowing the employee to challenge the decision.

    "instruction":"How close ethnically are modern Greeks to the ancient Greeks?\n",
    "output_1":"The short answer is that modern Greeks are about as ethnically similar to ancient Greeks as modern British people are to ancient British people. The differences are primarily cultural, not ethnic. The question of whether modern Greeks are ethnically identical to ancient Greeks is a contentious one, as it relates to debates about the origins of the Greek nation.\n\nOne major difference between ancient and modern Greeks is that the ancient Greeks did not call themselves 'Greeks' -- they called themselves Hellenes. The term \"Greek\" originates from the Roman Empire, when the Romans used the term \"Graeci\" to refer to the inhabitants of the southern part of the Balkans. Ancient Greeks, on the other hand, referred to themselves as Hellenes.\n\nThere are also differences between the modern Greek language and the ancient Greek language. Modern Greek is a descendant of ancient Greek, but it has evolved over the centuries and diverged significantly from its ancient counterpart. Modern Greek also contains loan words from other languages, including French, Turkish, and Slavic languages.\n\nAnother difference between ancient and modern Greeks is religion. Ancient Greeks worshipped a pantheon of gods, while modern Greeks are predominantly Christian. Ancient Greeks also practiced a variety of religious rituals, such as animal sacrifice, that are not practiced by modern Greeks.\n\nThere are also cultural differences between ancient and modern Greeks. Ancient Greeks lived in a society that was predominantly agricultural, while modern Greeks live in a predominantly urban society. Ancient Greeks also had a more decentralized political system, with many city-states (poleis) operating independently of each other, whereas modern Greece is a unitary state.\n\nIn summary, modern Greeks are ethnically similar to ancient Greeks, but there are also significant cultural differences between the two groups.\n",

    "instruction":"Has any research been done on whatleads to or is correlated with successful long distance relationships?\n",
    "output_1":"There have been several research studies conducted that have examined factors associated with long-distance relationships (LDRs). These studies have reported that several factors contribute to the success of LDRs, including trust, communication, commitment, and flexibility.\n\n## Trust\n\nOne of the most important factors in a successful LDR is trust. Without trust, it is difficult for couples to be intimate with one another, as they are unable to be vulnerable. Additionally, trust is important for feeling secure in the relationship and knowing that your partner will not betray you. Trust is built over time through consistent and honest communication.\n\n## Communication\n\nCommunication is crucial for all relationships, but especially for LDRs. Without consistent communication, it is easy for partners to misunderstand each other and for feelings of isolation and loneliness to develop. Additionally, communication helps to maintain intimacy and closeness in the relationship.\n\n## Commitment\n\nCommitment is important for all relationships, but especially for LDRs. Without commitment, it is easy for couples to feel disconnected and lose interest in each other. Additionally, commitment helps to keep partners accountable to one another and ensures that they prioritize the relationship.\n\n## Flexibility\n\nFlexibility is important for all relationships, but especially for LDRs. Without flexibility, it is easy for couples to feel frustrated and resentful when their partner cannot meet their needs. Additionally, flexibility helps to keep relationships fresh and exciting by allowing for new experiences and perspectives.\n\nIn conclusion, several factors contribute to the success of long-distance relationships, including trust, communication, commitment, and flexibility.\n",

Here is the abstract:\n\n> This review examines the current body of research regarding long-distance relationships (LDRs), focusing on studies that address the following three questions: (a) What are the demographics of LDRs? (b) What are the processes involved in LDRs? (c) What are the outcomes of LDRs? In answering these questions, we highlight the methodological issues that have plagued the field and call for greater methodological sophistication in future research.\n\nAnother useful review of the literature is by McCracken & Hendrick (1997). Their review focuses on how LDRs are managed.\n\nBoth Christensen & Anderson (2000) and McCracken & Hendrick (1997) found that LDRs are fairly common and that they can be successful. Some demographic differences between LDRs and non-LDRs were also found, with LDRs involving more younger, less educated, and more ethnically diverse couples. In terms of processes, research has found that communication and problem-solving are crucial to the success of LDRs. In terms of outcomes, LDRs are found to be at least as successful as non-LDRs in terms of relationship satisfaction, commitment, and stability.\n\nHope this helps!\n",

    "output_1":"It's not quite as simple as \"Soldiers are good people who just follow orders.\" The truth is that most people are quite willing to do horrible things if they are convinced that it's their duty to do so.\n\nThe idea that there are orders, that you must blindly follow, is designed into military structures. The people giving the orders are usually senior officers, often with political connections. Officers and politicians who fail to follow orders are typically disciplined or removed. The idea that there is a chain of command, that orders must be followed, is also deeply ingrained in the minds of soldiers. Disobedience is viewed as a threat to the entire military system.\n\nIf you look at any number of conflicts and wars, you will see that soldiers are quite willing to carry out orders to kill. Soldiers have killed people in wars all over the world, in both \"just\" wars and \"unjust\" wars.\n\nSoldiers will also kill civilians. For example, the United States has killed thousands of civilians in their drone attacks, and soldiers have killed civilians in countless conflicts. It is quite common for soldiers to kill civilians in wars. This is something that soldiers are trained to do, and it is something that soldiers are expected to do.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why soldiers are willing to kill innocent people. First, they are usually told that their targets are \"the enemy\" and that they are protecting their country and their friends. Second, soldiers are trained to kill. Soldiers are taught how to shoot guns, how to fight, and how to kill. Third, soldiers are given orders. Orders are viewed as coming from authority figures, and soldiers are trained to obey orders. Finally, soldiers are usually told that they are fighting for their country, and that what they are doing is necessary and good.\n\nIn summary, soldiers are willing to kill innocent people because they are trained to kill, they are told to kill, and they are told that killing is good and necessary.\n",

You can be a psychopath, and still be a CEO, or a politician, or a commander. Being a psychopath doesn't stop you from being able to make money, or gain power, or make people do what you want.\n\nThis is why we need systems of accountability. We need systems of checks and balances, so that people cannot just do what they want. We need laws and constitutions, so that we can protect people from the psychopaths who want to rule over them.\n",

    "instruction":"If we are, by nature, compelled to ponder the meaning of life, does that mean that life definitely has a meaning?\n",
    "output_1":"The idea that we are all seeking the meaning of life is a very old one. For thousands of years, philosophers have pondered the question of what our existence means. Some have argued that there is a purpose to life. Others have argued that there is not. And still others have argued that the question of whether life has a purpose is unanswerable.\n\nIn the Western philosophical tradition, the concept of a meaning of life goes back to Plato and Aristotle. Plato believed that the soul was immortal and that it existed before birth and after death. He also believed that each soul was assigned a particular role to play in life, and that the soul's goal was to return to its original home after death. Aristotle, on the other hand, believed that the soul was not immortal and that it ceased to exist after death. He also believed that the goal of life was happiness, not a return to some heavenly realm.\n\nIn the Christian tradition, the concept of a meaning of life is closely linked to the idea of a divine plan. According to the Bible, God created the world and everything in it, and He has a plan for how everything should work. The goal of human life, according to Christianity, is to live in accordance with God's plan and to enjoy eternal life in heaven after death.\n\nIn the Eastern philosophical tradition, the concept of a meaning of life is often linked to the idea of karma. According to Hinduism and Buddhism, every action has consequences, both good and bad. The goal of life, according to these traditions, is to eliminate the bad consequences of past actions and to accumulate good karma. This will lead to a happier life in this world and to spiritual enlightenment after death.\n\nSo, to answer your question: No, it doesn't necessarily follow that life has a meaning. What it means to say that we are compelled to seek the meaning of life is that we feel a need to understand why we are here and what our purpose is.\n",

    "instruction":"If you made a nuclear bomb using a heavier element, would it be more powerful by volume compared to hydrogen, helium, or uranium nuclear weapon? What element would yield the biggest result?\n",
    "output_1":"The answer is complicated, but here is a short version: yes, there are elements that are more energetic by volume than either uranium or hydrogen, but none of them are likely to be useful for making bombs.\n\nThe energy density of a nuclear weapon is proportional to the amount of energy that can be released per unit mass of the fuel. Since you are asking about energy release per unit volume, it is useful to look at the energy release per unit atom of the fuel, rather than per unit mass.\n\nHydrogen has the lowest energy release per unit atom of any element. Uranium is right in the middle. There are some elements that have a higher energy release per atom than uranium, and some that have a lower one. In general, the elements with the highest energy release per atom are the radioactive actinides.\n\nHowever, there is a second factor to consider: how many atoms can you put in the bomb? For most actinides, the answer is \"not very many\", because they are very chemically inert, which means that they don't react with other elements very well.\n\nThe reason uranium is useful for nuclear bombs is that it is relatively chemically active, which means that it can react with other elements. This means that it can be used to make compounds that are chemically stable, but which contain large numbers of uranium atoms. The most common compound of uranium is uranium dioxide (UO2), which is very chemically stable. UO2 can be made into a ceramic, which can then be shaped into pellets, which can then be put into a shell, which can then be made into a bomb.\n\nMost of the actinides are not chemically active, which means that they don't form compounds that are stable enough to be made into pellets. In fact, most of them are so chemically reactive that they can only be made into pellets in a particle accelerator.\n\nSo, the answer to your question is that there are elements with a higher energy release per atom than uranium, but there are none that are useful for making nuclear bombs.\n",

    "output_2":"Using a nuclear weapon is not like lighting a firecracker; the amount of heat released per mass of fuel is much lower in a nuclear bomb than in an ordinary explosion.\n\nTo understand why, consider the case of the most efficient conventional fuel: solid rocket fuel. It releases ~3.8 kJ\/g; this means that to produce 1 kJ of energy, you need only 0.25 g of solid rocket fuel.\n\nA nuclear bomb using U-235 would release ~15 MJ\/g. This is about 400 times more energy per gram!\n\nNow, you might ask, \"If a nuclear bomb is so much more energy dense, why don't we just make them all nuclear bombs?\" Well, there's the little problem of making them safe enough to transport. You don't want to end up with the Hiroshima incident if your nuclear bomb accidentally falls off the back of a truck.\n\nThis means that for a given weight of fuel, a nuclear bomb is much less powerful than a conventional bomb. How much less powerful? It depends on how well designed your bomb is, but a good rule of thumb is that a nuclear bomb is ~1,000 times less powerful per kilogram of fuel.\n\nThis is because nuclear weapons rely on fission, not combustion. The chemical reactions involved in combustion don't happen fast enough to be useful at the temperatures involved in nuclear fission.\n\nThis means that if you could make a nuclear weapon out of a heavier element, it would be less powerful, not more powerful.\n\nOf course, a bigger bomb isn't necessarily less effective. A smaller bomb is easier to transport, but a larger bomb is easier to aim.\n",

We can't measure the size of a particle, nor its shape.  This is a feature, not a bug, of the theories we have.\nIf you want to understand why particles are point-like, the best answer is probably to look at the theories we have and see how we go from a theory that says we can measure position and momentum to a theory where we can only measure momentum.\nIn QM, we can't measure position and momentum simultaneously because we have to choose a basis for our position eigenfunctions to measure in.  For position and momentum, we choose the Heisenberg basis, and the position and momentum operators don't commute in this basis.\nIn QED, we can't measure position and momentum simultaneously because the position operator is non-local.  In the Heisenberg basis, the momentum operator is local, but the position operator involves integrals over all space, and so it can't be measured in a local way.\nIn the Standard Model, we can't measure position and momentum simultaneously because we don't have enough information about the state of the particle to do so.  There are gauge symmetries that relate momentum and position operators in different ways, so if we only know the momentum, we can't reconstruct the position operator.\nIf you want to know why we can't measure the shape of particles, the best answer is probably to look at the Standard Model and see how we go from a theory where we can measure position and momentum operators to a theory where we can only measure momentum operators.\nIn quantum field theory, we don't have position operators.

The researchers of this study speculated that the reason for this finding is that adoption does not involve the same biological and psychological changes as having biological children.\n\nIn conclusion, there is some evidence that having children is associated with lower rates of depression, but the evidence is not clear or conclusive.  More research is needed to understand the effects of parenthood on mental health.\n",

I'm currently working on improving this weakness by setting clear goals for myself at the beginning of each work session and avoiding distractions until I've achieved those goals.\"\n\nIt is important to be honest when answering this question, but it is also important to frame your answer in a positive light. You want to make it clear that you're aware of your weaknesses and that you're working to improve them.\n\nAnother option is to turn the question around and say that your biggest strength is your awareness of your weaknesses and your willingness to work on improving them.\n\nYou can also mention a weakness that is not really a weakness, but something that others perceive as a weakness. For example, you can say that you work too hard and don't delegate enough, which is often seen as a weakness, but can actually be a strength.\n\nFinally, you can say that you don't have any weaknesses.

When the smell of death becomes too strong, it can be impossible to ignore. Your cat is under the deck. It is not alive. It is dead. The longer it has been dead, the more putrid it will smell.\n\nThe smell of death is a mixture of the decaying body, the bacteria that feed on it, and the fluids that come with death. There are some things you can do to try to reduce the smell, but you can't get rid of it entirely.\n\nThe smell is strongest right after death and declines over time as the body decays. The smell is also strongest near the body, so if you are near it, you will smell it more. The smell will also be stronger in warm, humid conditions and will be less strong in cold, dry conditions.\n\nThere are a few things you can do to try to reduce the smell. The first is to remove the body. If it is possible to do so, the best thing is to remove the body and dispose of it in a way that will not attract animals. If it is not possible to remove the body, you can try to cover it with something that will keep animals from getting to it. This may not be possible if the body is under a deck, but you may be able to cover it with boards or something else to keep animals from getting to it.\n\nYou can also try to clean up any fluids that are present. If there is blood, you can try to clean it up as best as you can. If there are fluids, you can try to clean them up with a bleach solution. Bleach is a powerful cleaner, but it is also toxic, so use it with care. You can also try to remove any items that are nearby and may be absorbing the smell, such as furniture or carpeting.\n\nIn addition to these steps, you can also try to reduce the smell by using air fresheners or incense. These may help to mask the smell, but they will not eliminate it.\n\nIf you are able to retrieve the body, you can try to have it cremated. This will help to reduce the smell, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it entirely. The smell of death is a strong smell and can be difficult to get rid of.\n",

    "instruction":"Are there parallels between the use of radio communication by nationalists in the 1930\u2019s and the use of social media\/Twitter by nationalists in the present day? Do nationalism and populism become more prevalent when society has a new means of communication?\n",
    "output_1":"It is an interesting question and there is some evidence that communication technologies can facilitate the spread of nationalism and populism.\n\nIn the 1930's, radio was a new and powerful medium that allowed the spread of nationalist and populist messages. This was particularly evident in Germany where the Nazi party used radio to great effect to spread their ideology and gain support. \n\nIn the present day, social media and other forms of digital communication are similarly powerful tools that can be used to spread nationalist and populist messages. For example, in the 2016 US presidential election, Donald Trump's campaign used social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to target their messages and gain support. \n\nIn both cases, the rise of new communication technologies facilitated the spread of nationalist and populist messages. These messages typically prey on the fears and insecurities of people and tap into existing divisions in society.\n\nIt is important to note that nationalism and populism are not inherently negative forces. They can be used to promote positive change and advance the interests of marginalised groups. However, they can also be used to spread hate and division. \n\nThe key is to use these technologies responsibly and to promote tolerance and understanding.\n",

    "output_2":"Yes, there are some parallels between the use of radio by nationalists in the 1930s and the use of social media by nationalists in the present day. Both radio and social media have been used by nationalists to spread their message and organize supporters. In both cases, nationalists have used new forms of communication to reach larger audiences and spread their ideas more quickly. \n\nIn the 1930s, radio was a new and important form of communication, and nationalists used it to spread their message and organize supporters. Adolf Hitler used radio to communicate directly with the German people, and he used propaganda on radio to spread his nationalist and racist ideas. The Nazi Party also used radio to broadcast propaganda and organize supporters, and radio was important in spreading Nazi ideology and rallying support for the party. \n\nSimilarly, in the present day, social media has become an important form of communication, and nationalists have used it to spread their message and organize supporters. Trump used social media extensively during his presidential campaign, and he continues to use it to spread his nationalist and populist ideas. Far-right groups and individuals also use social media to spread their messages and organize supporters, and social media has played an important role in spreading nationalist and populist ideas in the United States and Europe. \n\nBoth radio and social media have been used by nationalists to spread their message and organize supporters, and both have played an important role in spreading nationalist and populist ideas. Radio was important in spreading Nazi ideology and organizing supporters in the 1930s, and social media has played a similar role in spreading nationalist and populist ideas in the present day.\n",
